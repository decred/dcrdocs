#### **1. How secure is the web client?**

The web client is a fork of [Copay](https://copay.io), so it is as secure as that[^7981]. The seed (and hence private keys) are kept and computed locally in your browser's local storage and everything is run client-side. The server never has access to any of the private data needed to spend coins.

#### **2. Can you solo stake mine with the web client?**

No, recall that the browser wallet runs locally on your machine. That would not lend itself well to running 24/7. As a result, the browser wallet will never be able to solo stake[^9093]. It would however be possible to support stake pooling with it. Stake pools provide you with the ability to not have a wallet running 24/7 since it will be the pool's responsibility to be online and cast a vote on your behalf at that point.

#### **3. Is it safe to delete the wallet and start over?**

It is safe[^10652]. The only difference is you will need to go to `Import Wallet` this time instead of creating a new one.

## **Welcome To Decred**

Welcome to the world of Decred! We know that getting started with any new cryptocurrency
can be difficult and we want to make the journey as easy as possible. Decred is well
documented, with everything from basic information such as, "how do I send decred", to
super technical stuff like "why did you choose a BLAKE-256 hash function, and how does
it compare to the Merkle-Damg√•rd construction?".

So that you don't get overwhelmed by the amount of information available, we have created
this beginner's guide through the documentation. By following the links at the bottom of a few pages, you'll learn how to install, setup, and use the Decred applications; how to obtain DCR; how to vote via Proof-of-Stake; how to use the block explorer; and configure the software to use on the Testnet.

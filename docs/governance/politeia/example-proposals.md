# <img class="dcr-icon" src="/img/dcr-icons/Politeia.svg" /> Example Politeia Proposals

---

Below are two example Politeia proposals that utilize the template provided in the
Politeia [Proposal Guidelines](proposal-guidelines.md). The first example proposes the 
development of a new software feature. The second a marketing initiative.

- [Software Feature Proposal](#software-feature-proposal)
- [Marketing Proposal](#marketing-proposal)

## Software Feature Proposal

### What

In the *What* section, provide a short description of the problem that will 
be addressed.

> Develop a set of JavaScript libraries to enable JavaScript developers to
> easily add support for Decred into their applications.

### Why

In the *Why* section, answer why the proposal is needed and why it is
a good idea.

> According to stats collected by GitHub.com, JavaScript has been the most
> popular programming language for the last 6 years in a row.
> The number of developers and companies building with JavaScript is enormous,
> and providing a toolkit for them to easily integrate with the Decred
> blockchain will expose the project to a massive pool of talent and innovation.

### How

In the *How* section, describe the steps you will perform to accomplish your
goals.

> The basic framework for the JavaScript toolkit is already built and is
> available on GitHub.
> So far I have implemented:
>
> - secp256k1 elliptical curve for generation of keypairs, signature creation
>   and verification.
> - BIP-0044 keys and PGP mnemonic seeds.
>
> I will be continuing to develop this project and plan to add:
>
> - Clients for the dcrdata block explorer.
> - Serializable and de-serializable JavaScript versions of important types from
>   the dcrd/wire package.
> - Network parameters for mainnet, testnet3, and simnet.
> - A light wallet which will include sending and receiving DCR, staking, SPV
>   and LN.
> - DEX integration
>
> All of this code is open source, published under the
> [ISC license](https://github.com/decred/politeia/blob/master/LICENSE).
>
> In the case that this proposal is approved, the ownership of the existing
> GitHub repository will be transferred to the Decred organization.

### Who

In the *Who* section, describe the entity making the proposal, who will
complete the work, and who will draw down on the proposal's budget.

> This proposal is submitted by @allstake (on Matrix, /u/Satoshi2000 on reddit).
> You may remember me from a discussion in #proposals, where I solicited feedback
> on this idea (Matrix link).
> I have been active in the blockchain space for two years, with a particular
> interest and passion for blockchain governance.
> See my GitHub (github.com/satoshi200) for examples of my work, including an
> event-driven lambo address creation module.

### When

In the *When* section, describe the project's milestones, expected 
completion dates, and the draw schedule (how much is paid for each milestone delivered).

> - **secp256k1 curve, BIP-0044, mnemonic seeds** (40 hours of work already completed - **$1,500**)
> - **Block explorer clients** (6 hours of work - **$180**)
> - **dcrd/wire types** (10 hours of work - **$300**)
> - **Network parameters** (3 hours of work - **$90**)
> - **Wallet send/receive** (45 hours of work - **$1,350**)
> - **Wallet staking** (40 hours of work - **$1,200**)
> - **Wallet SPV** (100 hours of work - **$3,000**)
> - **Wallet LN** (120 hours of work - **$3,600**)
> - **DEX integration** (120 hours of work - **$3,600**)
>
> This will bring the grand total to 484 hours at a rate of 30 USD/hr.
> This proposal will therefore be capped **$14,520**.
>
> The proposed schedule is to do this work over 16 weeks, breaking this period
> into three milestones.
>
> **Milestone 1**
>
> Block explorer clients, wire types, parameters, wallet send/receive and
> staking.
>
> 104 hours, to be completed by week 4.
>
> **Milestone 2**
>
> Wallet SPV and LN.
>
> 220 hours, to be completed by week 11.
>
> **Milestone 3**
>
> DEX integration.
>
> 120 hours, to be completed by week 14.

## Marketing Proposal

### What

In the *What* section, provide a short description of the problem that will 
be addressed.

> This proposal would fund a Decred presence at Real Blockchain Conference, in Dublin, Ireland, July 11-13.
> It would cover costs for a booth, swag, and people to staff the booth.

### Why

In the *Why* section, answer why the proposal is needed and why it is
a good idea.

> Real Blockchain Conference is a top cryptocurrency conference and totally not made up. Last year's conference had 5,000 attendees and they seemed cool, good solid Decred stakeholder material.
> With epic swag and a physical embodiment of Stakey in attendance, a presence at this conference would raise awareness of Decred.

### How

In the *How* section, describe the steps you will perform to accomplish your
goals.

> * I will organize Decred's presence at this event, it will take about 20 hours of my time at 40$/hour: $800
> * Conference registration/booth fees: $3,000
> * Booth decorations: $1,000
> * Decred swag to give away: $2,000
> * 3 staff on the booth for 3 (10 hour) days each at $30/hr: (3 x 3 x 10 x 30) $2,700
> * Stakey costume: $500
> * Stakey costume occupant: 3 (10 hour) days at $40/hr (that suit is warm!): $1,200
> * Travel expenses for booth staff: Up to $2,000
> * Accommodation for booth staff. We will stay at the conference hotel costing $200/night, it is unlikely that all booth staff need accommodation, but the maximum would be 200 x 3 nights x 4 staff = $2,400
>
> Maximum total budget: $15,600

### Who

In the *Who* section, describe the entity making the proposal, who will
complete the work, and who will draw down on the proposal's budget.

> This proposal is submitted by @AllYourStake (on Matrix, /u/StakeGovernor2000 on reddit).
> You may remember me as the organizer of Decred's presence at such blockchain events as Real Blockchain Conference 2017 and Buckets of Blockchain 2018.
> I don't know exactly who the 3 booth staff and 1 Stakey suit wearer will be, I will be one of the staff and @Contributor1 is also interested.

### When

In the *When* section, describe the project's milestones, expected 
completion dates, and the draw schedule (how much is paid for each milestone delivered).

> Registration fees are due by September 30th, I will pay these up-front and request full reimbursement immediately.
> I will front the cost of the swag and Stakey suit, and claim this along with my travel/accommodation expenses and payment for my work, after the event.
> Booth staff who are already Decred contributors will bill for their hours and expenses directly, I will serve as intermediary for any staff costs not associated with established contributors.

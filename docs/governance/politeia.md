## What is Politeia?

Politeia is a platform that supports Decredâ€™s governance. It facilitates the submission, tracking, and discussion of Decred governance proposals by the stakeholder community. The Politeia [web platform](https://proposals.decred.org/) facilitates browsing, discussing and submitting proposals.

Reddit-style **up/down voting** is used for comment sorting. Up/down votes are not anonymous.

Voting on proposals does not happen directly on Politeia, but within official Decred wallets ([Decrediton](../getting-started/user-guides/decrediton-setup.md) or [politeiavoter CLI](https://github.com/decred/politeia/tree/master/politeiavoter) with dcrwallet).

There are two broad types of proposal:

1. Proposals that aim to establish voter support for a course of action. For example, the direction of software development, or adopting or changing some policy.
2. Proposals that commit to spending DCR from the Decred Treasury. These proposals create a budget that some entity can draw down against as they demonstrate progress towards the proposal's aim.

## How Politeia Works

To vote, stakeholders must time-lock DCR to buy tickets. While tickets are live they can be used to cast a vote for or against each open Politeia proposal. For more information on tickets and their role in Decred's governance, see the [introduction to Decred governance](../governance/introduction-to-decred-governance.md) page.

There is a fee for submitting a proposal (0.1 DCR) to limit the potential for proposal spamming. There is also a fee for registering a Politeia account (0.1 DCR) to limit comment spam and up/down voting sock-puppetry. Fees may be altered if a) they aren't serving as a sufficient spam-deterrent, or b) the price of DCR changes considerably.

### Transparent Censorship

When proposals are submitted, they are checked by Politeia administrators. Proposals that are deemed spam or invalid will be censored.

Politeia is built around the concept of **transparent censorship**, using [dcrtime](https://github.com/decred/dcrtime). Users cannot be silently censored; they can prove that censorship has occurred. When a proposal/comment is submitted, a censorship token is generated. Content creators can use these tokens to demonstrate that their specific proposal/comment was submitted, in a particular form, at a particular point in time.

Censorship tokens are tied to a **cryptographic identity** (pub/priv key pair) created when you register for a Politeia account. This identity is only used for demonstrating that your submissions have been censored. This key-pair is stored in your browser by default. For now, it is important to **verify your account from the same browser you used to sign up**. 

### Proposal Lifecycle

Below is the basic process for submitting and evaluating proposals:

1. A proposal is submitted.
2. The proposal is reviewed by Politeia admins, spam is censored. 
3. Valid proposals appear publicly on Politeia. They are open for discussion, but voting does not begin immediately, and the proposal can be edited by its owner in response to community feedback. 
4. The proposal owner authorizes voting to start. An admin then triggers the start of voting.	
5. The ticket-voting interval of 2016 blocks (~1 week) begins. A snapshot of the live ticket pool is taken at 256 blocks prior to the start of voting. Every ticket in this snapshot can vote 'Yes' or 'No' on the proposal. Tickets bought after the snapshot for a proposal cannot vote on it. Tickets that vote on-chain can still be used to vote on a proposal if they were live when the snapshot was taken.
6. When the ticket-voting period ends, the proposal is formally approved or rejected. There is a quorum requirement for a vote to be considered valid: 20% of the eligible tickets must vote 'Yes' or 'No'. The threshold for a proposal to be approved is 60% 'Yes' votes.
7. When a proposal with a budget and deliverables is approved, work can begin. The proposal owner can submit claims against the budget as deliverables are completed.
8. Payment claims will be handled manually by Decred Holdings Group (DHG) until such times as this process can be handled by the [Decred Decentralized Autonomous Entity (DAE)](#decentralized-autonomous-entity-dae).

For guidance on creating a good proposal, see the [proposal guidelines](../governance/politeia/proposal-guidelines.md) and [example proposals](../governance/politeia/example-proposals.md) pages.

### Decentralized Autonomous Entity (DAE)

Politeia's aim is to serve as the decision-making force behind the Decred Decentralized Autonomous Entity (DAE). This is an ambitious aim. Because Politeia and its accompanying processes are still in an experimental stage, Politeia will serve initially as a robust signaling mechanism from Decred shareholders to the community members controlling the Decred Treasury wallet. Over time, this will be iterated towards a DAE that decentralizes the functions currently performed by trusted humans, and the DAE will control the project fund wallet directly.

## Politeia Data

All proposals, comments, and votes are anchored on the Decred blockchain using [dcrtime](https://github.com/decred/dcrtime) and stored in a public [git repository](https://github.com/decred-proposals/mainnet). See the [navigating politeia data](../advanced/navigating-politeia-data.md) pagefor instructions on accessing and interpreting Politeia data.

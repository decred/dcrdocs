## Welcome To Decred 

This beginner's guide introduces Decred and offers signposts to some useful resources.

Decred is an autonomous digital currency. Stakeholders make and enforce the blockchain's consensus rules, set a course for future development, and decide how the project's treasury is used to fund it. Decred's blockchain is similar to Bitcoin's, but with major aspects of [governance](/governance/governance.md) baked into the protocol. 

[Proof of Work](/mining/proof-of-work.md) miners play a similar role for Decred as they do for Bitcoin, but with Decred they only receive 60% of the block reward.

[Proof of Stake](/mining/proof-of-stake.md) voting is central to Decred's governance. Decred holders can time-lock (or "stake") DCR to obtain voting tickets. Tickets are randomly called to vote on-chain, this involves both approving the work of PoW miners and voting Yes/No on any open [rule change proposals](/getting-started/user-guides/agenda-voting.md). 30% of the block reward goes to the holders of the tickets that voted in that block.

The remaining 10% of the block reward goes into a [Project Treasury fund](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx). Holders of live tickets decide how that treasury is used through [Politeia proposals and voting](/governance/politeia.md).

The [Decred Constitution](/getting-started/constitution.md) sets out some guiding principles for the project, the constitution is subject to amendment through Politeia proposals.

## Wallets

[Decrediton](/getting-started/user-guides/decrediton-setup/) is Decred's GUI wallet, it supports Voting through [stakepools](https://decred.org/stakepools/) and offers the easiest way to start buying tickets and participating in governance.

There is also a [Command Line Interface](/getting-started/user-guides/cli-installation/) and set of tools for more advanced users, these include running a personal Voting wallet.

### Contributing

Decred is always looking for new contributors. A basic outline of how this works is: Show up, Find something useful to do, Do it, Get Paid. Do a small bit at first and see if other contributors in that domain appreciate it. This [blog post](https://blog.decred.org/2017/07/25/Decred-Recruiting/) explains the project's recruitment philosophy and approach in more detail.

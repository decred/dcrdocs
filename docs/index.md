## <img class="dcr-icon" alt="Decred logo" src="/img/dcr-icons/DCRsymbol.svg" /> What is Decred?
Decred is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency with a strong focus on community input, open governance, and sustainable funding for development. It utilizes a hybrid Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mining system to ensure that a small group cannot dominate the flow of transactions or make changes to Decred without the input of the community. A unit of the currency is called a decred (DCR).

## How Does it Work?
Stakeholders make and enforce the blockchain's consensus rules, set a course for future development, and decide how the project's treasury is used to fund it. Decred's blockchain is similar to Bitcoin's, but with major aspects of [governance](governance/introduction-to-decred-governance.md) baked into the protocol. 

To align incentives, block rewards are split between PoW miners, stakeholders and the Project Treasury, which funds Decred’s development. 

[Proof of Work](mining/proof-of-work.md) miners play a similar role for Decred as they do for Bitcoin, but with Decred they only receive 60% of the block reward.

[Proof of Stake](mining/proof-of-stake.md) voting is central to Decred's governance. Decred holders can time-lock (or "stake") DCR to obtain voting tickets. Tickets are randomly called to vote on-chain; this involves both approving the work of PoW miners and voting Yes/No on any open [rule change proposals](governance/consensus-rules-voting.md). 30% of the block reward goes to the holders of the tickets that voted in that block.

The remaining 10% of the block reward goes into a [Project Treasury fund](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx). Holders of live tickets decide how that treasury is used through [Politeia proposals and voting](governance/politeia.md).

The [Decred Constitution](governance/decred-constitution.md) sets out some guiding principles for the project; the constitution is subject to amendment through Politeia proposals.

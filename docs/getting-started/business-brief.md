## What is Decred?

Decred is a decentralized, autonomous digital currency
[governed directly by its voting stakeholders](../governance/overview.md).
Stakeholders vote to decide on consensus rule changes, as well as matters of
Treasury and policy. Decred is self-funded by a portion of the block reward.

## Why is Decred needed?

Decred was born from its
[founders’ experiences with Bitcoin’s governance](https://blog.companyzero.com/2015/11/bitcoins-biggest-challenges/).
Company 0 developed a Bitcoin full node implementation called
[btcsuite](https://github.com/btcsuite/), but the software was not well received
by the Bitcoin Core development team. With Bitcoin, the Core developers and
Proof-of-Work miners are strong, centralized constituencies that can effectively
veto changes to the consensus rules — other stakeholders in the Bitcoin
ecosystem have minimal influence. The absence of a clear method for making
decisions results in protracted disputes and chain splits, whereby a
sub-community breaks off and creates an alternative version of the currency.
This weakens the network effects and dilutes the project’s resources. Bitcoin
also has a funding problem, which has been addressed with venture capital
investment, bringing with it conflicts of interest. Decred is a better
cryptocurrency because it addresses these shortcomings.

## How does Decred work?

Decred [iterates on Bitcoin](https://blog.companyzero.com/2015/12/iterating-bitcoin/)
by employing an innovative hybrid Proof-of-Work (PoW)/Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
system and Politeia governance platform to solve the issues of centralization,
funding, and governance.
In Decred’s hybrid system, PoW acts similarly as with Bitcoin, but miners only
receive 60% of the block reward. Thirty percent of the Decred block reward goes
to PoS voters who quality control the miners’ work, reducing the power of the
miners, putting power in the hands of the coin holders, and securing the
network. The final 10% of the block reward goes into the Treasury to fund
development and operations. The self-funding element ensures that Decred is
sustainable over the long term.

The most powerful differentiator of Decred are its governance mechanisms,
including Politeia. Everyone is welcome to contribute thoughts and ideas
informally on its discussion platforms and social media, but formal decisions
are made in Politeia by those who contribute through PoS.

Decred holders participate in PoS voting by time-locking (staking) funds in
exchange for tickets. Tickets confer voting rights, and ticket voting
determines:

1. Consensus rule changes (on-chain)
1. Validation of PoW miners’ work
1. Treasury project funding (Dev work, communications, events, research, etc.)
1. Policy (Constitutional amendments, procedures, standards, etc.)

The time-locking mechanism ensures that voters have “skin in the game”, and the
PoS portion of the block reward incentivizes staking and active participation in
the governance model. Decred seeks to attract intelligent investors who are
interested in actively participating in our self-funding, decentralized,
self-governing project.

## The evolution of Decred

Decred launched in February 2016. There was no ICO or venture capital
funding-Company 0 self-funded Decred’s development for two years. At launch,
[8% of the total supply was pre-mined](../advanced/premine.md), with 4% used to
compensate the developers (at a rate of $0.49 per DCR), and 4% air-dropped to
2,972 people who signed up (each received 282.63795424 DCR).

Early on, the project focused on implementing the
[process to amend the consensus rules](../governance/consensus-rule-voting/overview.md).
The first changes were adopted was approved by ticket-voters in June
2017, marking the first time any cryptocurrency upgrade was deployed
automatically following a user voting approval process.

With on-chain consensus rules working, Decred’s shifted focus to building
[Politeia](../governance/politeia/overview.md), its platform for managing policy
and budget. Politeia was launched in October of 2018, and marks a major
milestone in the road to a fully decentralized, autonomous organization.

The project Treasury has been preserved by the custodians to this point, with a
belief that major expenditures should wait until they can be formally approved
by stakeholders in Politeia. The result is a [Treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury)
greater than 570K DCR, worth more than $20 million at October 2018 prices.

Decred is poised to accelerate its development, in the direction set by its
stakeholders. The treasury’s large balance will amplify the effect of DCR price
increases on its spending power, and its continual replenishment means that
long-term developer support is guaranteed. Current projects and proposals
include privacy upgrades, support for Lightning Network, an expanded
communications plan, and a
[decentralized exchange](https://blog.decred.org/2018/06/05/A-New-Kind-of-DEX/).

## How is work on Decred organized?

Decred uses a novel autonomous contractor model that allows for new individuals,
groups, and companies to be paid for contributing to the project. Decred’s
longstanding developers are open source software veterans and enthusiasts, and
so Decred’s way of organizing and funding development is designed to fit with
the open source ethos. Autonomy of contributors and meritocracy are the key
principles around which work on Decred is organized.

Decred’s treasury funds are purely for the advancement of the project, free of
any other constraints. It is unprecedented for open source projects to have
access to this kind of funding. One of the big advantages of commons-based peer
production is that contributors can efficiently select pieces of work that fit
with their skills and interests. Decred aims to unlock the true potential of
this approach by developing a funding model tailored to this new way of working.

- **36+ developers** who contribute new code, maintain current code, and
  implement roadmap features in Decred’s open source software repositories.
- **15 contributors** to maintaining and developing various community and media
  channels.
- **4 marketing professionals** who handle event organization, public relations,
  and digital marketing.
- **9 designers** who work alongside the developers and marketing contractors to
  develop solutions in disciplines of (1) UX/UI, (2) identity, and (3) visual
  communications.

## Decred in Q4 2018

[SPV Wallet Support](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/issues/1000) —
Instead of taking the typical wallet service approach where wallets connect to a
centralized server, we have added support for a proper SPV mechanism that uses
compact filters and works over the P2P network, an approach which does more to
protect the privacy of users.

[Network Security](https://btcmanager.com/hardware-companies-are-launching-dedicated-asic-miners-for-decred) —
A large number of ASIC manufacturers have released or announced ASICs for Decred
in 2018, and the network’s PoW hashrate has increased from around 300 Thash/s in
September 2017 to over 100,000 Thash/s in September 2018 - a 333x increase.

[Politeia](https://blog.decred.org/2018/10/15/Politeia-in-Production/) —
Decred’s governance proposal submission, discussion, and voting platform is
almost ready to go live. Politeia is built around the concept of transparent
censorship, giving users who are censored the power to prove what was censored
and hold administrators accountable. This robust public record of governance
proceedings provides a solid foundation upon which to build up the Decred
Decentralized Autonomous Organization which will ultimately govern the treasury
and the project’s direction.

[Lightning Network](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd) —
Lightning Network support is being developed. The two projects’ respective lead
developers work closely together — LND and Decred are based on btcsuite, which
was also developed by Decred’s founding developers.

[Enhanced User Privacy](https://blog.decred.org/2019/08/28/Iterating-Privacy/) —
This highly anticipated project within the Decred community has been kept under
wraps thus far, however the details and an initial implementation are expected
to be revealed soon.

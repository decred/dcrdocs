# **The Paymetheus Windows Wallet** #
This guide assumes you have already set up a Paymetheus wallet using [this guide](paymetheus.md).

---

## **Overview** ##
The overview tab gives a quick summary of your total DCR (spendable and locked), number of accounts and transactions as well as a list 
of recent account activity.  

![Overview tab](/img/Paymetheus-overview.png)  

---


## **Accounts  ** ##
The accounts tab shows you the accounts in your wallet and allows you to add new ones. Accounts in Decred work just like bank accounts. 
They allow you to keep seperate records of your DCR. This feature is most 
useful for those who run businesses and wish to keep seperate accounts for 
tax records for example. Transferring DCR across accounts will create a 
transaction on the blockchain.

## **Scripts** ##
Currently only used for PoS mining in a pool. If you sign up for a pool, 
you will be asked to import a script. This is where you will add it.
See the Purchase Tickets section below for more information.

## **Create Transaction** ##
This tab is how you send funds to another address. Simply copy the receivers
address into the text box and type in the amount of Decred you wish to send.
The estimated fee will be listed as well. You can click the '+' button to 
send Decred to multiple accounts in the one transaction if you wish.

## ** Purchase Tickets tab** ##

Stake pools are also usable with Paymetheus by using its manual ticket
purchasing features.  

> To join the pool, provide a public key address which can be used to generate a
> 1-of-2 multisignature script. The multisignature script will be generated by
> the pool and returned to you along with a P2SH address to give voting rights to.  

Don't worry if you didn't understand that quote. What it means is that you create
an address that can be accessed by two wallets. Only one wallet needs to be available
to use the address. This means that the pool can vote on your behalf and you can vote
using your own wallet if the pool stops working.  

It DOES NOT give the pool access to your funds. All you are doing is granting voting
rights to the wallet. This is why you provide a ticket address so the network knows
where to send your funds to after the ticket votes/expires. The pool does not touch
your funds.  

It is recommended that you generate a new account when joining a stake pool. This is
because accounts are hardened so in the case of a total stake pool
failure/shutdown, it would be safe to give the private key to another stake pool
as long as that account only does voting and nothing else.  

Official stake pools are [listed here](/mining/proof-of-stake#sign-up-for-a-stake-pool).
All stake pools run the same basic code, but may differ in the amount of redundancy available.
More redundancy equals less chance of missed votes (although all pools will have missed votes
as many missed votes are caused by PoW miners). In order to ensure one pool does't become too large,
it is recommended that you join a smaller pool. This further minimizes the (VERY) small chance that a pool
owner could exert influence over the way their pool votes if it's too large. Decred already contains checks
for this, but by spreading tickets around pools, it makes the network even less decentralized.

![Creating voting account](/img/Paymetheus-create-voting-account.png)  

To generate a public key address, use the "Request Payment" view to generate a
new address for the voting account.  The pubkey address (below the shorter P2PKH
address) will be given to the pool.

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> **On mainnet, the address will begin with the letters Ds.**

![Generate pubkey address](/img/Paymetheus-generate-pubkey-address.png)  

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> **On mainnet, the public key address will begin with the letters Dk.**

Copy and paste the public key address into the stake pool's submit address form
and click the submit button.  Your multisig script and P2SH address will be
generated and you will be redirected to the tickets page.

Next, import the pool's 1-of-2 multisignature script (on the Scripts tab).  This allows the funds to
be recovered in case of pool failure.

Finally, tickets can be purchased.  Select the "Using a pool?" checkbox and copy
the values from the pool.  When all fields are set and if there is enough input
value is available, the purchase button will become enabled and tickets may be
purchased.

NOTE: While you can purchase tickets using Paymetheus, it cannot vote for you so at this time you must use a pool.
If you would prefer to solo mine, check the [Getting Started](/getting-started/overview.md) 
and [PoS Mining](/mining/proof-of-stake.ms) guides for more information.

## **Request Payment** ##
This is where you can generate wallet addresses to give to other people so they can
send you DCR. Simply choose the account you want funds to go to and press Generate Address.
Copy the address (it's the top line that starts with Ds) and share that with the other person.
The public key below is what is passed to the blockchain. You don't need to worry about it.
Decred addresses can be used as many times as you want, but for privacy reasons it's best
to generate a new one for each transaction. There's around 1.4E59 (that's 1.4 followed by 59 zeroes)
addresses available so you don't need to worry about running out.

## **Transaction History** ##
This tab shows a list of all transactions that occured. The transaction hash can be used with the
[block explorer](/getting-started/using-the-block-explorer.md) to see more information about the transaction.

## **Stake Mining** ##
This tab shows some statistics on the PoS network:  

Item                         | Description
-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------
Number of live tickets       | This is the number of tickets that are eligible for voting.
Number of tickets in mempool | This is number of tickets waiting to enter the voting pool.
Ticket difficulty            | The cost of a ticket (refunded on ticket vote/expiry).
Owned tickets in mempool     | Your tickets in the mempool.
Owned live tickets           | Your tickets eligible for voting.
Owned immature tickets       | Tickets entering the voting pool must wait to mature before becoming live (256 blocks, ~17 hours)
Tickets missed               | Tickets that missed a vote either because the wallet was offline or the PoW miner didn't mine it properly.
Tickets revoked              | Missed tickets are revoked and the ticket price is refunded to you (minus the ticket fee).
Tickets voted                | Lifetime tickets voted by this wallet.
Total subsidy earned         | Lifetime DCR subsidy earned by this wallet.

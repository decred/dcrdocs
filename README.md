# dcrdocs

Documentation for [Decred].

## Installation

dcrdocs is built with [MkDocs]. In order to install MkDocs you will need [Python] installed on your system, as well as the Python package manager, [pip]. You can check if you have these already installed from the command line:

```bash
$ python --version
Python 2.7.6
$ pip --version
pip 8.1.1
```

MkDocs supports Python versions 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5.

On Windows it is recommended that you install Python and pip with [Chocolatey].

Install the `mkdocs` package, [python-markdown-math] \(required for rendering equations\), [mkdocs-bootswatch] themes, and fontawesome packages using pip:

```bash
$ pip install mkdocs python-markdown-math mkdocs-bootswatch fontawesome-markdown
```

## Getting started

Getting started is super easy.

```bash
$ cd dcrdocs
```

There is a single configuration file named `mkdocs.yml`, and a folder named `docs` that will contain the documentation source files. MkDocs comes with a built-in dev-server that lets you preview the documentation as you work on it. Make sure you are in the same directory as the `mkdocs.yml` configuration file, and then start the server by running the `mkdocs serve` command:

```bash
$ mkdocs serve
INFO    -  Building documentation...
INFO    -  Cleaning site directory
[I 160402 15:50:43 server:271] Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000
[I 160402 15:50:43 handlers:58] Start watching changes
[I 160402 15:50:43 handlers:60] Start detecting changes
```

Open up <http://127.0.0.1:8000> in your browser, and you will see the default home page being displayed. The dev-server also supports auto-reloading, and will rebuild your documentation whenever anything in the configuration file, documentation directory, or theme directory changes.

## Building the site

To deploy dcrdocs, first build the documentation:

```bash
$ mkdocs build
```

This will create a new directory, named `site`. After some time, files may be removed from the documentation but they will still reside in the `site` directory. To remove those stale files, just run `mkdocs` with the `--clean` switch.

```bash
$ mkdocs build --clean
```

To view a list of options available on a given command, use the `--help` flag with that command. For example, to get a list of all options available for the `build` command run the following:

```bash
$ mkdocs build --help
```

## Deploying

The version of dcrdocs that you just built only uses static files so you will be able to host it from pretty much anywhere. You can view a live version of the documentation at https://docs.decred.org.

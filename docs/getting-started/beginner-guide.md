## Welcome To Decred 

This guide offers signposts to some useful resources, including how to set up your Decred wallet, buy DCR, participate in Decredâ€™s governance, connect with the community and contribute to the project (contributors welcome!). 

## Wallets

[Decrediton](../wallets/decrediton/decrediton-setup.md) is Decred's GUI wallet. It supports Voting through [Voting Service Providers](https://decred.org/vsp/) and offers the easiest way to start buying tickets and participating in governance.

There is also a [Command Line Interface](../wallets/cli/cli-installation.md) that exposes more advanced functionality, including the ability to run a personal Voting wallet.

### Contributing

Decred is always looking for new contributors. A basic outline of how this works is: Show up, Find something useful to do, Do it, Get Paid. Do a small bit at first and see if other contributors in that domain appreciate it. This [blog post](https://blog.decred.org/2017/07/25/Decred-Recruiting/) explains the project's recruitment philosophy and approach in more detail.

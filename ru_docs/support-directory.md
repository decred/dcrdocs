# **Support Reference Directory**

The purpose of this page is to provide a directory for support contacts. Everyone currently working with the Decred project has their Slack and/or IRC username listed.

## Join Us on Slack

Join us on Slack for support. You can receive an invite to the Decred Slack by visiting [https://slack.decred.org](https://slack.decred.org). Once you've signed up, you can join using your web browser by visiting [https://decred.slack.com](https://decred.slack.com) or by downloading one of Slack's desktop or mobile applications.

## IRC Information:

Majority of the developers are available on the Freenode IRC #decred channel. Join us on your own IRC client or the Freenode webchat [here](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=decred&uio=d4). There is also a bridge between Slack's #general channel and the #decred channel on IRC.

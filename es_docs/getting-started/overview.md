The first thing you will need to do to get started with Decred is
create your wallet. Your wallet is like a bank account. It can contain
many address and like your bank account you don't want to give anyone
else access to it. An address is like a sub account. If you want to
receive DCR from someone else, you give them an address that is linked
to your wallet. You can create a new address for each transaction or
reuse the same address multiple times but it is strongly recommended
that you do not reuse addresses. Your wallet can generate as many
address as you want.  There are three parts to getting started with
Decred:

* Connecting to the Decred network by starting a node.
* Creating your wallet and attaching it to the node.
* Controlling your wallet and performing transactions.

Once you're setup and online there are four ways you can add DCR to
your wallet.

* Purchase from an exchange
* Proof-of-Work mining
* Proof-of-Stake mining (assuming you already have some DCR)
* Have someone send you some DCR


Note: You might soon notice one of the many differences between Decred and other 
popular cryptocurrencies: the wallet daemon and node daemon are separate.
A lot of other coins run these functions together in a single daemon.
For those who choose to use the command line interfaces, this means you must
run `dcrd` for full node functionality, and `dcrwallet` to store your DCR,
create transactions and participate in Proof-of-Stake mining/voting.

This section describes the web wallet.  The web wallet is a basic
online wallet that allows you to send and receive DCR. It is still
under development and so lacks a number of features that are in the
command line wallet (for example, stake mining is not currently
supported).

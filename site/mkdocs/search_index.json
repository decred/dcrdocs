It utilizes a hybrid \nproof-of-work\n and \nproof-of-stake\n mining system to ensure that a small group cannot dominate the flow of transactions or make changes to Decred without the input of the community. A unit of currency is called a \ndecred\n (DCR). To ensure the integrity of the currency and prevent people from making fraudulent transactions or creating their own coins, Decred uses a method of recording transactions known as a blockchain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWhat is a cryptocurrency?\n\n\nA cryptocurrency is a system of \nvalue exchange\n, just like any real world currency you may be familiar with. Its main difference is that it is not controlled by a central government or group and thus cannot be manipulated or restricted in the way those currencies can be.\n\n\nAs an example, you may buy Decred from a fiat currency exchange and use it to directly purchase a product in a different country without having to pay high exchange rates.\nDecred uses a wallet to store, transfer and receive DCR. This wallet signs every transaction in and out with a special public key that is unique to you. This is how the network knows that the address sending the transaction is the correct one. Think of your bank account and PIN. When you use your card (wallet) you also enter your PIN (public key) so the bank knows it was you that authorized the transaction. The main difference here is that the public key is known by everyone on the network whereas your PIN is not. When you start using Decred, you will generate a private key that you must not give to anyone.\n\n\n\n\n \nWhat is the blockchain?\n\n\nThe blockchain is the heart of Decred. It is where all transactions that take place are stored. It is similar to a bank ledger in that it records all the activity that happens when DCR are transferred. This ledger is able to confirm that new transactions are valid and that no fraud is taking place.\n\n\nEach block in the blockchain is a record of transactions that have occurred since the last block (about 5 minutes). Every computer (node) in the Decred network shares this blockchain. Nodes in the network run an algorithm many times over a block looking for a solution with a known difficulty. This process is known as \nproof-of-work\n mining. Once the solution is found it is broadcast to the network. The network then verifies the solution (finding the solution is very hard, but verifying it is easy). Decred uses an extra step of verification known as \nproof-of-stake\n mining. Stakeholders who have purchased tickets now have the chance to vote on the block. 5 tickets are chosen randomly from the ticket pool and if at least 3 of them vote \nyes\n the block is permanently added to the blockchain and the transactions are cleared. Both PoS and PoW miners are compensated with DCR for the resources used to mine the block.",

Choose\nthe zip for either \ndecred-[version]-windows-386-[date]\n if you have a\n32-bit version of Windows or \ndecred-[version]-windows-amd64-[date]\n\nif you have 64-bit\n(\nHow can I tell?\n). If\nyou are running Windows Vista or higher, you may need to unblock the\nzip file. After the file has downloaded, open the file location in\nExplorer, right click the file, and choose properties. You may see a\nsecurity section at the bottom. Click \nUnblock\n then\n\nOK\n. Double-click the zip to open it and copy the files in it to any\nlocation, e.g., \nC:\\Decred\n. Now we need a command prompt. Open the\nfolder where you copied the files. In the location bar at the top,\ntype in \ncmd\n and press \nEnter\n.\n\n\n\n\nStep Two\n\n\n\n\nYou should now have a command prompt window open. Type the following\n(replacing the text in square brackets with your own values):\n\n\nC:\\Decred\n dcrd --rpcuser [daemon username] --rpcpass [daemon password]\n\n\n\n\nChoose any username and password.  You do not need to register these\nanywhere and they will only be used to allow your wallet and control\ntool to communicate with the daemon you are running.  Save these, you\nwill need them later. You can also put them in a file so you do not\nneed to specify them on the command line or in scripts (See:\n\nStoring Login Details\n). This\nprogram is what is known as the daemon. It works in the background and\nyou will not interface with it directly. It exists solely to connect\nyou to the network.\n\n\n\n\nStep Three\n\n\n\n\nYou should now get a whole lot of text as the daemon connects to the\nnetwork and starts processing blocks. Wait until it is completed. You\nwill see a line at the start like:\n\n\n22:58:04 2016-02-09 [INF] BMGR: Syncing to block height 617 from peer 104.236.167.133:9108\n\n\n\n\nThen, as it downloads the blocks, you will see lines like:\n\n\n22:58:16 2016-02-09 [INF] BMGR: Processed 321 blocks in the last 10.03s (544 transactions, height 322, 2016-02-09 09:50:34 +1000 EST)\n\n\n\n\nOnce the most recent block your daemon has processed is the current\nblock height (you can either tell by the date and time in the log\nmessage or by comparing the height against the\n\nonline block explorer\n.  This may take\nquite some time as the block height grows larger (there is no\nlimit). Note that you are not mining at this point, you are just\nconnected to the network. This connection will be used in the future.\nYou must leave this cmd window open to use the wallet.\n\n\n\n\n Create your wallet\n\n\n\n\nStep One\n\n\n\n\nNow that you are connected to the network, the next thing you need to\ndo is create a wallet that will hold your account addresses and DCR\nbalance. If you participate in mining or stake mining, this is where\nyour payments will go.\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n\n\n\n\nDuring the creation process you will be provided with a list of 33\nwords that form the private key for your wallet. Treat this list in\nthe same way you would a physical key to a safe. If you lose your key\nyou lose access to your wallet and all funds within it permanently. It\ncannot be recovered, not even by Decred developers. It is up to you to\nkeep a backup. It is recommended you write it down on paper then store\nthat somewhere secure. If you decide to keep it on your computer, it\nwould be best to keep it in an encrypted document (just do not forget\nthe password) in case the file or your computer is stolen which brings\nus to the next point:\n\n\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT\n\n\n\n\nDO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, GIVE YOUR KEY WORDS OR THE\n  ASSOCIATED HEX KEY TO ANYONE! NOT EVEN THE DEVELOPERS!\n\n\nWe will discuss the hex key soon. If you give someone either key,\nthey can use that to copy your wallet which gives them full access to\nyour funds. It is like cutting a copy of a key, giving it to some\nrandom person on the train and telling him where the safe it opens\nis. And that you will be out of town for a few days. So to reiterate,\nkeep your key words safe and do not give them to anyone else. With\nthat in mind follow these steps to create a wallet:\n\n\n\n\nStep Two\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you have the \ndcrd\n daemon running (See:\n\nConnecting to the Decred network\n). Open\na new command prompt in your Decred folder. To do that, open Windows\nExplorer, navigate to your Decred folder and type \ncmd\n in the\nlocation box at the top then press \nEnter\n. Type: \ndcrwallet --create\n\nand press \nEnter\n.\n\n\nC:\\Decred\n dcrwallet --create\nEnter the private passphrase for your new wallet:\n\n\n\n\nEnter a password that you will use for this wallet. It should be\ndifferent to the one you used for the daemon. \nEnter\n again to\nconfirm. Make sure you save this somewhere.\n\n\nDo you want to add an additional layer of encryption for public data? (n/no/y/yes) [no]:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep Three\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see above you will now be asked if you want extra\nencryption for your public wallet. If you say \nyes\n then you should\nuse a password that is different from any of the other passwords you\nused in this guide.  We will have a look at putting all these\npasswords in a configuration file so you do not need to remember them\nin a seperate \ntutorial\n.\n\n\nDo you have an existing wallet seed you want to use? (n/no/y/yes) [no]:\n\n\n\n\nYou are now asked if you have an existing seed. This is the list of\nwords that make up your private key as explained above. Since this is\na new wallet, say no.  If you ever need to recreate your wallet from\nthe seed, this is where you would enter it.  Your key words will now\nbe displayed. If you have a seed, say yes and enter that instead.\n\n\n\n\nALSO VERY IMPORTANT\n\n\n\n\nSTOP HERE! TOUCH NOTHING!\n\n\nRead this entire step before you do anything. There are two very\nimportant pieces of information displayed on the screen. The first,\nand most important part is your key words. These words form the\nprivate key that is used to generate your wallet. If you lose this list\n(and the order they appear in) your wallet will be lost forever and\nany funds it contains will be lost permanently. As was mentioned\nabove, no one, not even the developers can retrieve them.\n\n\nThe second part is your hex key. This is generated from your key\nwords. Write this down as well, as you will use it to confirm you\nentered your seed words correctly if you need to restore your wallet.\nThe two forms of the key are completely equivalent although most\npeople find the key words easier to deal with.\n\n\n\n\nStep Four\n\n\n\n\nWrite down the key words and hex and store them somewhere\nsafe. Seriously. This is the most important step. Also remember these\nwords (and the hex string) are the keys to your wallet. Do not give\nthem to anyone else. If you do, they can restore your wallet on their\ncomputer and steal your DCR.\n\n\nYour wallet generation seed is:\n[list of 33 words]\n\nHex: [long string of letters and numbers]\nIMPORTANT: Keep the seed in a safe place as you\nwill NOT be able to restore your wallet without it.\nPlease keep in mind that anyone who has access\nto the seed can also restore your wallet thereby\ngiving them access to all your funds, so it is\nimperative that you keep it in a secure location.\nOnce you have stored the seed in a safe and secure location, enter \nOK\n to continue:\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have written the key words and hex down type \nOK\n and press\n\nEnter\n. It should be noted that if you did not write the words down\nbefore continuing or somehow otherwise lost them, start this process\nagain (See: \nHow Do I Remove My Wallet?\n).\n\n\nCreating the wallet...\nThe wallet has been created successfully.\n\n\n\n\nThe wallet will now be created. This might take a few minutes if you\nhave a slow computer.\n\n\n\n\n Connect your wallet to the Decred network\n\n\nNow that you have \ncreated your wallet\n and\n\nconnected to the Decred network\n,\nyou need to link your wallet to the network so it can send and receive\ncoins and participate in mining.\n\n\n\n\nStep One\n\n\n\n\nOpen another command prompt in your Decred folder (or use the last one\nif you have just created your wallet). Type the following (filling in\nyour own info instead of the square brackets):\n\n\nC:\\Decred\n dcrwallet -u [wallet username] -P [wallet password] --dcrdusername=[daemon username] --dcrdpassword=[daemon password]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, the wallet username.  You have not used this before, so just\n  make one up. It is only used to allow the control program to\n  connect to the wallet.\n\n\nSecond is the wallet password.  You have not used this before, so just\n  make one up. It is only used to allow the control program to\n  connect to the wallet.  Note the capital P, Decred is case sensitive.\n\n\nThird and fourth are the username and password you used when staring\n  the daemon (Step Two in the\n  \nConnecting to the Decred network\n\n  guide).\n\n\nAlternatively, if you use the same username/password combination for\n  both dcrd and dcrwallet you can skip \n--dcrdusername\n and\n  \n--dcrdpassword\n and just use \n-u\n and \n-P\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe wallet will now connect to the network via the daemon. It will\nbegin scans of the network and active addresses which can take a few\nminutes on slow computers. Eventually it will start showing lines\nlike:\n\n\n[INF] WLLT: Connecting block 0000000000002004ea8fa74af334cb291a22832642b5be603995683534bbb97b, height 9990\n\n\n\n\nThis means your wallet is successfully connected to the network\nthrough your daemon.\n\n\n\n\nStep Two\n\n\n\n\nFinally, you will need to unlock your wallet to allow it to send and\nreceive funds. To do so we will introduce the third program in the\nDecred suite; \ndcrctl\n. This is the program you will use to control\nDecred. Open a third command prompt in your Decred folder. Type in\n(once again using your values for the square brackets):\n\n\nC:\\Decred\n dcrctl -u [daemon username] -P [daemon password] --wallet walletpassphrase [wallet password] 0\n\n\n\n\nWhat we are doing here is authenticating with the daemon and using the\n\n--wallet\n command to send the wallet password to unlock the\nwallet. The \n0\n means unlock without a time limit. Do note, however,\nthat this only unlocks the wallet for the current session. If you\nclose the window the wallet is running in, you will need to unlock it\nagain the next time you start it. You will not get a confirmation from\n\ndcrctl\n, but if you look at your wallet window, it will say:\n\n\n[INF] RPCS: The wallet has been unlocked without a time limit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep Three\n\n\n\n\nThat is it! You are now up and running. Some things you might want to try:\n\n\n\n\nPurchase Decred from an exchange\n\n\nPut your credentials in a file\n\n\nProof-of-Work mining\n\n\nProof-of-Stake mining\n\n\nAdvanced dcrctl usage",

If you lose your key\nyou lose access to your wallet and all funds within it permanently. It\ncannot be recovered, not even by Decred developers. It is up to you to\nkeep a backup. It is recommended you write it down on paper then store\nthat somewhere secure. If you decide to keep it on your computer, it\nwould be best to keep it in an encrypted document (just do not forget\nthe password) in case the file or your computer is stolen which brings\nus to the next point:   VERY IMPORTANT   DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, GIVE YOUR KEY WORDS OR THE\n  ASSOCIATED HEX KEY TO ANYONE! NOT EVEN THE DEVELOPERS!  We will discuss the hex key soon. If you give someone either key,\nthey can use that to copy your wallet which gives them full access to\nyour funds. It is like cutting a copy of a key, giving it to some\nrandom person on the train and telling him where the safe it opens\nis. And that you will be out of town for a few days. So to reiterate,\nkeep your key words safe and do not give them to anyone else. With\nthat in mind follow these steps to create a wallet:   Step Two   Make sure you have the  dcrd  daemon running (See: Connecting to the Decred network ). Open\na new command prompt in your Decred folder. To do that, open Windows\nExplorer, navigate to your Decred folder and type  cmd  in the\nlocation box at the top then press  Enter . Type:  dcrwallet --create \nand press  Enter .  C:\\Decred  dcrwallet --create\nEnter the private passphrase for your new wallet:  Enter a password that you will use for this wallet. It should be\ndifferent to the one you used for the daemon.  Enter  again to\nconfirm. Make sure you save this somewhere.  Do you want to add an additional layer of encryption for public data? (n/no/y/yes) [no]:   Step Three   As you can see above you will now be asked if you want extra\nencryption for your public wallet. If you say  yes  then you should\nuse a password that is different from any of the other passwords you\nused in this guide.  We will have a look at putting all these\npasswords in a configuration file so you do not need to remember them\nin a seperate  tutorial .  Do you have an existing wallet seed you want to use? (n/no/y/yes) [no]:  You are now asked if you have an existing seed. This is the list of\nwords that make up your private key as explained above. Since this is\na new wallet, say no.  If you ever need to recreate your wallet from\nthe seed, this is where you would enter it.  Your key words will now\nbe displayed. If you have a seed, say yes and enter that instead.   ALSO VERY IMPORTANT   STOP HERE! TOUCH NOTHING!  Read this entire step before you do anything. There are two very\nimportant pieces of information displayed on the screen. The first,\nand most important part is your key words. These words form the\nprivate key that is used to generate your wallet. If you lose this list\n(and the order they appear in) your wallet will be lost forever and\nany funds it contains will be lost permanently. As was mentioned\nabove, no one, not even the developers can retrieve them.  The second part is your hex key. This is generated from your key\nwords. Write this down as well, as you will use it to confirm you\nentered your seed words correctly if you need to restore your wallet.\nThe two forms of the key are completely equivalent although most\npeople find the key words easier to deal with.   Step Four   Write down the key words and hex and store them somewhere\nsafe. Seriously. This is the most important step. Also remember these\nwords (and the hex string) are the keys to your wallet. Do not give\nthem to anyone else. If you do, they can restore your wallet on their\ncomputer and steal your DCR.  Your wallet generation seed is:\n[list of 33 words]\n\nHex: [long string of letters and numbers]\nIMPORTANT: Keep the seed in a safe place as you\nwill NOT be able to restore your wallet without it.\nPlease keep in mind that anyone who has access\nto the seed can also restore your wallet thereby\ngiving them access to all your funds, so it is\nimperative that you keep it in a secure location.\nOnce you have stored the seed in a safe and secure location, enter  OK  to continue:  Once you have written the key words and hex down type  OK  and press Enter . It should be noted that if you did not write the words down\nbefore continuing or somehow otherwise lost them, start this process\nagain (See:  How Do I Remove My Wallet? ).

Step One   Open another command prompt in your Decred folder (or use the last one\nif you have just created your wallet). Type the following (filling in\nyour own info instead of the square brackets):  C:\\Decred  dcrwallet -u [wallet username] -P [wallet password] --dcrdusername=[daemon username] --dcrdpassword=[daemon password]   First, the wallet username.

Third and fourth are the username and password you used when staring\n  the daemon (Step Two in the\n   Connecting to the Decred network \n  guide).  Alternatively, if you use the same username/password combination for\n  both dcrd and dcrwallet you can skip  --dcrdusername  and\n   --dcrdpassword  and just use  -u  and  -P .   The wallet will now connect to the network via the daemon. It will\nbegin scans of the network and active addresses which can take a few\nminutes on slow computers. Eventually it will start showing lines\nlike:  [INF] WLLT: Connecting block 0000000000002004ea8fa74af334cb291a22832642b5be603995683534bbb97b, height 9990  This means your wallet is successfully connected to the network\nthrough your daemon.   Step Two   Finally, you will need to unlock your wallet to allow it to send and\nreceive funds. To do so we will introduce the third program in the\nDecred suite;  dcrctl . This is the program you will use to control\nDecred. Open a third command prompt in your Decred folder. Type in\n(once again using your values for the square brackets):  C:\\Decred  dcrctl -u [daemon username] -P [daemon password] --wallet walletpassphrase [wallet password] 0  What we are doing here is authenticating with the daemon and using the --wallet  command to send the wallet password to unlock the\nwallet. The  0  means unlock without a time limit. Do note, however,\nthat this only unlocks the wallet for the current session. If you\nclose the window the wallet is running in, you will need to unlock it\nagain the next time you start it. You will not get a confirmation from dcrctl , but if you look at your wallet window, it will say:  [INF] RPCS: The wallet has been unlocked without a time limit.   Step Three   That is it! You are now up and running.

Third and fourth are the username and password you used when staring\n  the daemon (Step Two in the\n   Connecting to the Decred network \n  guide).  Alternatively, if you use the same username/password combination for\n  both dcrd and dcrwallet you can skip  --dcrdusername  and\n   --dcrdpassword  and just use  -u  and  -P .   The wallet will now connect to the network via the daemon. It will\nbegin scans of the network and active addresses which can take a few\nminutes on slow computers. Eventually it will start showing lines\nlike:  [INF] WLLT: Connecting block 0000000000002004ea8fa74af334cb291a22832642b5be603995683534bbb97b, height 9990  This means your wallet is successfully connected to the network\nthrough your daemon.   Step Two   Finally, you will need to unlock your wallet to allow it to send and\nreceive funds. To do so we ll introduce the third program in the\nDecred suite; dcrctl. This is the program you will use to control\nDecred. Open a third terminal and go to your Decred directory. Type in\n(once again using your values for the square brackets):  ~/Decred/$ ./dcrctl -u [daemon username] -P [daemon password] --wallet walletpassphrase [wallet password] 0  What we are doing here is authenticating with the daemon and using the --wallet  command to send the wallet password to unlock the\nwallet. The  0  means unlock without a time limit. Do note, however,\nthat this only unlocks the wallet for the current session. If you\nclose the window the wallet is running in, you will need to unlock it\nagain the next time you start it. You will not get a confirmation from dcrctl , but if you look at your wallet terminal/ screen  session, it\nwill say:  [INF] RPCS: The wallet has been unlocked without a time limit.   Step Three   That is it! You are now up and running.

Extract\nit to a directory (e.g., \n~/Decred\n).  OS X is frequently identified as\n\nDarwin\n so the binaries provided are named decred-darwin.  Open three\ncommand terminals. If you are running in headless mode via SSH, you\nwill need to use a terminal multiplexer such as \nscreen\n\n(\nHow do I use \nscreen\n?\n)\nor \ntmux\n. Where you see the instruction to\nmove to another terminal, you\nll need to start a new window in screen\nor tmux..\n\n\n\n\nStep Two\n\n\n\n\nGo to one of your terminals and change to the Decred directory that\nyou extracted the files to. They will likely be under a subdirectory\nsuch as \n~/Decred/decred-darwin-amd64\n. Type the following (replacing\nthe text in square brackets with your own values):\n\n\n~/Decred/$ ./dcrd --rpcuser [daemon username] --rpcpass [daemon password]\n\n\n\n\nChoose any username and password.  You do not need to register these\nanywhere and they will only be used to allow your wallet and control\ntool to communicate with the daemon you are running.  Save these, you\nwill need them later. You can also put them in a file so you do not\nneed to specify them on the command line or in scripts (See:\n\nStoring Login Details\n). This\nprogram is what is known as the daemon. It works in the background and\nyou will not interface with it directly. It exists solely to connect\nyou to the network.\n\n\n\n\nStep Three\n\n\n\n\nYou should now get a whole lot of text as the daemon connects to the\nnetwork and starts processing blocks. Wait until it is completed. You\nwill see a line at the start like:\n\n\n22:58:04 2016-02-09 [INF] BMGR: Syncing to block height 617 from peer 104.236.167.133:9108\n\n\n\n\nThen, as it downloads the blocks, you will see lines like:\n\n\n22:58:16 2016-02-09 [INF] BMGR: Processed 321 blocks in the last 10.03s (544 transactions, height 322, 2016-02-09 09:50:34 +1000 EST)\n\n\n\n\nOnce the most recent block your daemon has processed is the current\nblock height (you can either tell by the date and time in the log\nmessage or by comparing the height against the\n\nonline block explorer\n.  This may take\nquite some time as the block height grows larger (there is no\nlimit). Note that you are not mining at this point, you are just\nconnected to the network. This connection will be used in the future.\nYou must leave this cmd window open to use the wallet.\n\n\n\n\n Create your wallet\n\n\n\n\nStep One\n\n\n\n\nNow that you are connected to the network, the next thing you need to\ndo is create a wallet that will hold your account addresses and DCR\nbalance. If you participate in mining or stake mining, this is where\nyour payments will go.\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n\n\n\n\nDuring the creation process you will be provided with a list of 33\nwords that form the private key for your wallet. Treat this list in\nthe same way you would a physical key to a safe. If you lose your key\nyou lose access to your wallet and all funds within it permanently. It\ncannot be recovered, not even by Decred developers. It is up to you to\nkeep a backup. It is recommended you write it down on paper then store\nthat somewhere secure. If you decide to keep it on your computer, it\nwould be best to keep it in an encrypted document (just do not forget\nthe password) in case the file or your computer is stolen which brings\nus to the next point:\n\n\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT\n\n\n\n\nDO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, GIVE YOUR KEY WORDS OR THE\n  ASSOCIATED HEX KEY TO ANYONE! NOT EVEN THE DEVELOPERS!\n\n\nWe will go through the hex key soon. If you give someone either key,\nthey can use that to copy your wallet which gives them full access to\nyour funds. It\ns like cutting a copy of a key, giving it to some\nrandom person on the train and telling him where the safe it opens\nis. And that you will be out of town for a few days. So to reiterate,\nkeep your key words safe and do not give them to anyone else. With\nthat in mind follow these steps to create a wallet:\n\n\n\n\nStep Two\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you have the \ndcrd\n daemon running (See:\n\nConnecting to the Decred network\n). Open\na new terminal or screen. Navigate to the Decred\nfolder and type: \n./dcrwallet --create\n and press \nEnter\n.\n\n\n~/Decred/$ ./dcrwallet --create\nEnter the private passphrase for your new wallet:\n\n\n\n\nEnter a password that you will use for this wallet. It should be\ndifferent to the one you used for the daemon. \nEnter\n again to\nconfirm. Make sure you save this somewhere.\n\n\nDo you want to add an additional layer of encryption for public data? (n/no/y/yes) [no]:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep Three\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see above you will now be asked if you want extra\nencryption for your public wallet. If you say \nyes\n then you should\nuse a password that is different from any of the other passwords you\nused in this guide.  We will have a look at putting all these\npasswords in a configuration file so you do not need to remember them\nin a seperate \ntutorial\n.\n\n\nDo you have an existing wallet seed you want to use? (n/no/y/yes) [no]:\n\n\n\n\nYou are now asked if you have an existing seed. This is the list of\nwords that make up your private key as explained above. Since this is\na new wallet, say no.  If you ever need to recreate your wallet from\nthe seed, this is where you would enter it.  Your key words will now\nbe displayed. If you have a seed, say yes and enter that instead.\n\n\n\n\nALSO VERY IMPORTANT\n\n\n\n\nSTOP HERE! TOUCH NOTHING!\n\n\nRead this entire step before you do anything. There are two very\nimportant pieces of information displayed on the screen. The first,\nand most important part is your key words. These words form the\nprivate key that is used to generate your wallet. If you lose this list\n(and the order they appear in) your wallet will be lost forever and\nany funds it contains will be lost permanently. As was mentioned\nabove, no one, not even the developers can retrieve them.\n\n\nThe second part is your hex key. This is generated from your key\nwords. Write this down as well, as you will use it to confirm you\nentered your seed words correctly if you need to restore your wallet.\nThe two forms of the key are completely equivalent although most\npeople find the key words easier to deal with.\n\n\n\n\nStep Four\n\n\n\n\nWrite down the key words and hex and store them somewhere\nsafe. Seriously. This is the most important step. Also remember these\nwords (and the hex string) are the keys to your wallet. Do not give\nthem to anyone else. If you do, they can restore your wallet on their\ncomputer and steal your DCR.\n\n\nYour wallet generation seed is:\n[list of 33 words]\n\nHex: [long string of letters and numbers]\nIMPORTANT: Keep the seed in a safe place as you\nwill NOT be able to restore your wallet without it.\nPlease keep in mind that anyone who has access\nto the seed can also restore your wallet thereby\ngiving them access to all your funds, so it is\nimperative that you keep it in a secure location.\nOnce you have stored the seed in a safe and secure location, enter \nOK\n to continue:\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have written the key words and hex down type \nOK\n and press\n\nEnter\n. It should be noted that if you did not write the words down\nbefore continuing or somehow otherwise lost them, start this process\nagain (See: \nHow Do I Remove My Wallet?\n).\n\n\nCreating the wallet...\nThe wallet has been created successfully.\n\n\n\n\nThe wallet will then be created. This might take a few minutes if you\nhave a slow computer.\n\n\n\n\n Connect your wallet to the Decred network\n\n\nNow that you have \ncreated your wallet\n and\n\nconnected to the Decred network\n,\nyou need to link your wallet to the network so it can send and receive\ncoins and participate in mining.\n\n\n\n\nStep One\n\n\n\n\nOpen another terminal in your Decred directory (or use the last one if\nyou have just created your wallet). Type the following (filling in\nyour own info instead of the square brackets):\n\n\n~/Decred/$ ./dcrwallet -u [wallet username] -P [wallet password] --dcrdusername=[daemon username] --dcrdpassword=[daemon password]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, the wallet username.  You have not used this before, so just\n  make one up. It is only used to allow the control program to\n  connect to the wallet.\n\n\nSecond is the wallet password.  You have not used this before, so just\n  make one up. It is only used to allow the control program to\n  connect to the wallet.  Note the capital P, Decred is case sensitive.\n\n\nThird and fourth are the username and password you used when staring\n  the daemon (Step Two in the\n  \nConnecting to the Decred network\n\n  guide).\n\n\nAlternatively, if you use the same username/password combination for\n  both dcrd and dcrwallet you can skip \n--dcrdusername\n and\n  \n--dcrdpassword\n and just use \n-u\n and \n-P\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe wallet will now connect to the network via the daemon. It will\nbegin scans of the network and active addresses which can take a few\nminutes on slow computers. Eventually it will start showing lines\nlike:\n\n\n[INF] WLLT: Connecting block 0000000000002004ea8fa74af334cb291a22832642b5be603995683534bbb97b, height 9990\n\n\n\n\nThis means your wallet is successfully connected to the network\nthrough your daemon.\n\n\n\n\nStep Two\n\n\n\n\nFinally, you will need to unlock your wallet to allow it to send and\nreceive funds.

The \n0\n means unlock without a time limit. Do note, however,\nthat this only unlocks the wallet for the current session. If you\nclose the window the wallet is running in, you will need to unlock it\nagain the next time you start it. You will not get a confirmation from\n\ndcrctl\n, but if you look at your wallet terminal/\nscreen\n session, it\nwill say:\n\n\n[INF] RPCS: The wallet has been unlocked without a time limit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep Three\n\n\n\n\nThat is it!

The following sections will\nreview each type of transaction.\n\n\n\n\nStandard transactions\n\n\nHere is the information included in an unconfirmed standard\ntransaction that went through the Decred network.

Depending on the\nfees in the mempool, this will take five minutes on average. Once\nthere is at least one confirmation, the transaction is considered\ncomplete.\n\n\n\n\nTicket purchases\n\n\nFOr a ticket purchase (stake submission) there are a few differences\nfrom a standard transaction shown.\n\n\nNote the difference under details: The word \nTicket\n appears above the\nsender\ns wallet address on the left, and the words \nSubsidy\nCommitment\n appear on the right. This particular user purchased a\nstake ticket for 8.75411638 DCR and received change in the amount\nof 7.15994209 DCR. The address listed on the left under \nTicket\n is\nthe address that that contains the funds used to purchase this\nticket. The first output on the right is the address that retains\nvoting rights for this specific ticket. The second output, \nSubsidy\nCommitment\n, is the address where the reward will go. This is not yet\nshown by the block explorer at this time. The third and final output\nis the address where change for this transaction will be sent.\n\n\n\n\nProof-of-stake votes\n\n\nNote the identifying terms in the details section: \nVote\n, \nStake\nBase\n, \nBlock Commitment\n, and \nVote Bits\n:\n\n\nThese keywords indicate that this transaction is a vote that was cast\nfrom a proof-of-stake ticket holder. In this particular example, the\nuser had previously purchased a ticket for 8.99472311 DCR and was\nsent 10.82959184 DCR after the vote was cast in this transaction.",

How can I see information about the port numbers \ndcrd\n uses?\n\n\nYou can get the port numbers\n1\n from the \n-h\n or \n--help\n parameters passed to \ndcrd\n:\n\n\ndcrd -h\n\n\n\n\nLook for the following line:\n\n\n--rpclisten=  Add an interface/port to listen for RPC connections (default port: 9109, testnet: 19109)\n\n\n\n\nIt is also logged when you start \ndcrd\n:\n\n\n12:01:46 2016-02-08 [INF] RPCS: RPC server listening on [::1]:9109\n12:01:46 2016-02-08 [INF] RPCS: RPC server listening on 127.0.0.1:9109\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. What do you mean by configuration files for \ndcrd\n, \ndcrwallet\n, and \ndcrctl\n?\n\n\nEach application (\ndcrd\n, \ndcrwallet\n, \ndcrctl\n) can have their own configuration files\n2\n. Use \n-h\n and look at the path in parenthesis of the configuration file option (\n-C\n, \n--configfile\n) to see the default path. Create a text file at the path and named according to that path you just looked up.\n\n\nThen you can use the \ndcrd\n \nsample config file\n and \ndcrwallet\n \nsample config file\n to set whatever options you want. You can do the same thing for \ndcrctl\n too. The format is the same. Every command line option listed by \n-h\n can be specified in the config files (just use the long option name).\n\n\nOnce those are created and in place, you do not have to add all of the options to the command line all the time. That is why you can do:\n\n\ndcrctl getnetworkhashps\n2547036949350\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Can I run mainnet and testnet daemons and wallets at the same time and on the same machine?\n\n\nYes\n3\n, just add \n--testnet\n to the appropriate spots (\ndcrd\n, \ndcrwallet\n, \ndcrctl\n) and everything will work. This is why they use different ports and data/log directories!\n\n\n\n\n4. What are the security implications of using the same RPC server authentication passwords with \ndcrd\n and \ndcrwallet\n?\n\n\nThere is a lot less you can do with access to \ndcrd\n than you can to \ndcrwallet\n. The key point is that RPC access\n4\n to \ndcrwallet\n, when the wallet is unlocked, can be used to spend coins.\n\n\nWhen they are both on the same machine, it probably does not matter all that much, but when you are running more secure setups where the wallet is on a separate machine than \ndcrd\n, you would pretty clearly not want to use the same credentials for both. Remember that \ndcrd\n has to be on an Internet-facing machine in order to stay synced to the network (download the block chain data, broadcast transactions, and so on).\n\n\nOn the other hand, the \ndcrwallet\n that contains your funds, for best security, should really not be on a system that has Internet access as it is significantly more difficult for someone to steal your coins if the wallet that contains them is not even on a machine that is accessible via the Internet. Obviously, if you are staking your coins, you will need at least one Internet-facing \ndcrwallet\n instance. Thus, the most secure setup involves having one \ncold\n \ndcrwallet\n instance that is on a machine that is not Internet-accessible, and a second \nhot\n \ndcrwallet\n instance (using a different seed of course) to which the cold dcrwallet instance delegates voting right via the \n--ticketaddress\n parameter, both of which use different credentials.\n\n\n\n\n5. Why am I connecting to only 8 outbound peers?\n\n\nThere is an intentional unconfigurable limit of 8 outbound peers\n5\n. More outbound peers than that does not help you in any way and is actually worse for both you and the network. This has been tested extremely thoroughly in Bitcoin, including btcsuite (the upstream project for Decred). All you would do by upping your outbound connections is waste valuable slots of the relatively few public peers there are (there are always a much higher number of \nleechers\n than there are \nseeders\n).\n\n\nOn the other hand, increasing your maximum connections, which really just increases the number of allowed inbound connections, helps the network by ensuring there are more slots available for new nodes and SPV clients which Decred does not have yet, but it will.\n\n\n\n\n Sources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecred Forum, \nPost 8,929\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecred Forum, \nPost 9,062\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecred Forum, \nPost 9,264\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecred Forum, \nPost 11,480\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecred Forum, \nPost 15,399",

Doing so is the equivalent of giving them all of your DCR in that wallet.\n\n\n\n\n2. How can I convert my wallet seed hex to seed words?\n\n\nYou can use the \ndcrseedhextowords\n2\n utility to convert a Decred seed from hex to the seed words needed for importing into wallets.\n\n\n\n\n3. Can I run multiple wallets?\n\n\nRunning multiple wallets\n3\n with the same seed will absolutely lead to the situation where the wallets will not see the same balance. You should not be running multiple wallets with the same seed.\n\n\nThe problem is simply that addresses are generated deterministically from the seed. So if you have two wallets running on the same seed, you basically end up with a situation like this:\n\n\n\n\nWallet A: Knows about all addresses up to address #15\n\n\nWallet B: Knows about all addresses up to address #12\n\n\n\n\nSo, any coins that have been sent to addresses #13, #14, and #15 will be known to Wallet A, but not Wallet B.\n\n\nFurther, if you simply tell Wallet B to get the next address it also will not see the coins because, from its point of view, that address just now came into existence and so it will not search for transactions before the current point in time. This is an optimization because, as you can imagine, the blockchain ends up getting extremely large over time and it would be incredibly expensive (in terms of resource usage) to scan the entire chain every time a new address is generated.\n\n\n\n\n4. Can someone steal my coins if they access wallet.db?\n\n\nNobody can steal your coins if they get access to the wallet.db\n4\n file unless they also have your private passphrase. If you chose to use public encryption, they also cannot get access to any of your extended public keys or addresses.\n\n\n\n\n5. Can someone use a brute-force attack on a random wallet to regenerate its seed words (the words are not salted)?\n\n\nAll the seed words are is a direct mapping of English words to hex digits. The seed is nothing more than a 256-bit (32-byte) cryptographically random number. Salt does not apply here at all. It has nothing to do with brute-forcing\n5\n random cryptographic numbers.\n\n\nIn other words, since each word can be 256 possibilities and there are 32 words, that yields 256^32 (or 2^256 depending on how you want to look at it, but it is the same number) possibilities. That number is larger than the entire number of hydrogen atoms in the known universe. In fact, it is almost more than the number of atoms total in the known universe.\n\n\nTo put this in perspective, assuming there are 7 billion people on the planet and each person owned 10 computers and each one of those computers could test a billion possibilities a second and that you could find the solution on average after testing only 50% of the total possibilities, it would still take 26x10^48 (that\ns 26 trillion trillion trillion trillion) years to brute-force a single seed.\n\n\n\n\n6. My seed is not working. What can I do?\n\n\nMake sure all of the words are on a single line separated by spaces\n6\n. Even though they are printed out on multiple lines for readbility, they must be entered on a single line. Also double-check your words have no typos by comparing them to the words in the \nPGP word list\n.\n\n\n\n\n7. How do I import a key that is in wallet import format (WIF)?\n\n\nIt is possible to import a standalone private key\n7\n into \ndcrwallet\n. Note that this is only for \n--noseed\n addresses and you should not run this unless you know what you are doing!\n\n\nUnlock the wallet (ignore square brackets):\n\n\ndcrctl --wallet walletpassphrase [private encryption passphrase] 60\n\n\n\n\nImport the standalone (\n--noseed\n) private key (ignore square brackets):\n\n\ndcrctl --wallet importprivkey [put WIF private key here]\n\n\n\n\nView balance of imported account (give it some time to rescan and look at the log in dcrwallet to see rescan progress):\n\n\ndcrctl --wallet getbalance \nimported\n 0 all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. What is the difference between a testnet and mainnet address?\n\n\nA testnet public key address\n8\n that starts with Tk. A mainnet address starts with Dk. T = Testnet, D = (Decred) Mainnet.\n\n\n\n\n9. What are the different types of addresses?\n\n\nA Decred address\n9\n is actually just a representation of a public key (which itself could be a script hash) along with a 2-byte prefix which identifies the network and type and a checksum suffix in order to detect improperly entered addresses.\n\n\nConsequently, you can always tell what type of address it is based on the 2-byte prefix.\n\n\nThe first byte of the prefix identifies the network. This is why all mainnet addresses start with \nD\n, testnet addresses start with \nT\n, and simnet addresses start with \nS\n. The second byte of the prefix identifies the type of address it is.\n\n\nThe most common addresses used at the moment are secp256k1 pubkey hashes, which are identified by a lowercase \ns\n. It represents a single public key and therefore only has a single associated private key which can be used to redeem it.\n\n\nThe stake pool, however, uses a pay-to-script-hash address, which is identified by the second byte being a lowercase \nc\n (again that is shown in the linked params). The specific flavor of script it generates is a multi-signature 1-of-2, which is how it allows either the pool, or you, to vote. Both you and the stake pool have your own private keys and since the script only requires one signature of the possible two, that is how it allows delegation of voting rights to the pool without you giving up your voting rights completely.\n\n\n\n\n Sources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecred Forum, \nPost 8,613\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecred Forum, \nPost 8,660\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecred Forum, \nPost 9,731\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecred Forum, \nPost 9,803\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecred Forum, \nPost 10,452\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecred Forum, \nPost 10,657\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecred Forum, \nPost 10,724\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecred Forum, \nPost 11,507\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecred Forum, \nPost 14,995",

Further, if you simply tell Wallet B to get the next address it also will not see the coins because, from its point of view, that address just now came into existence and so it will not search for transactions before the current point in time.

Since it takes blocks time to relay, other nodes might have seen 0000000000001aedcf1b82b087a1d05ef787550174da1012e473e8ee8c178937 first which means to them the other solution that your node saw first ( 000000000000147d33cde5e9823122924fb43405418712720eb6457956d8edbb ) was the one on the side chain.  This is totally normal and resolves itself whenever the next block is found since it will now define the longest chain and whichever solution was not built on will be orphaned.  In this case, block #17880 ( 000000000000154c6091747245e3c2620447c71b346aed09548e74b4543d0d66 ) ended up building on top of 000000000000147d33cde5e9823122924fb43405418712720eb6457956d8edbb, so the other solution ( 0000000000001aedcf1b82b087a1d05ef787550174da1012e473e8ee8c178937 ) was orphaned.",

How should I set the txfee?\n\n\nThe txfee (or ticket fee) determines the order in which mempool tickets enter the voting pool. Higher fees encourage proof-of-work miners to put your tickets at the front of the queue. If you set the fee higher than the average your tickets are more likely to be included in the next block. The default txfee is 0.01 DCR. It would seem then that the best idea is to set your txfee high so you are at the front of the line. But that is not always a good idea. In fact, it is rarely a good idea simply because the mempool queue is very short or zero most of the time. Do not forget that the txfee will eat into your DCR profit as it is changed on every ticket and is non-refundable whether or not it votes.\n\n\nConsider a constant stake cost of 10 DCR. Every block 20 tickets can move into the voting pool from the mempool. That is a value of 200 DCR. Every block generates about 30 DCR and returns 50DCR to the voters. 3 DCR is sent to the developers to help fund development of Decred so only 27 ends up in the hands of miners. This means that 77 DCR is freed up each block to go back into tickets, assuming that all returns are reinvested. That is less than half of what the block can handle. The only way more DCR can enter the mempool is by external investment (i.e., buying from an exchange) or from miners who have been saving their DCR waiting for the stake cost to drop.\n\n\nIn the case of a cost drop, a miner is looking to get into the pool before the cost changes again. This happens every 144 blocks (about 12 hours). It does not matter if it is in the first block or the 100th. In 144 blocks 2,880 tickets will be accepted with a value of 28,800 DCR. There is not that sort of volume in the proof-of-stake network at this time. There is one scenario in which you might want to set your fee higher. If the stake cost is about to change in a few blocks, the mempool is not empty and you want to make sure you get the current price, it can help to set your fee a little higher than average to ensure you get in, especially if the next change will mean you miss a ticket.\n\n\n\n\n Sources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecred Forum, \nPost 9,987\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecred Forum, \nPost 10,219",

In the source code TicketPoolSize is set to 8,192, but the current ticket pool size is larger than that. Why?\n\n\nIt is intentional and is an integral part of the dynamic ticket price adjustment\n2\n. The \nTicketPoolSize\n is the target ticket pool size and it works very similar to the target difficulty for proof-of-work (PoW). The fact the current ticket pool size is larger than the target is what causes the ticket price to rise which in turn will eventually cause less tickets to be purchased and result in the number of tickets in the pool reducing back towards the target. If it falls under, the price will fall to encourage more ticket sales in order to increase the number of tickets in the pool towards the target.\n\n\n\n\n3. If I am unlucky and my ticket expires without voting, do I lose the transaction fee?\n\n\nYes\n3\n.\n\n\n\n\n4. Voting on mainnet was on \nhold\n up until block 4,096, with people buying tickets. Does this mean there will be a significantly higher risk for these tickets to expire?\n\n\nNo\n3\n, the expiration time does not start until a ticket is actually mined into a block. The tickets were just sitting in the memory pool until they could be included in blocks starting with block 4,096.\n\n\n\n\n5. What happens if none (or less than 3) of the selected voters issue their ssgen transactions?\n\n\nVotes are always determined by the current tip. Miners do not start mining for a new block until at least 3+ of the selected voters issue their ssgen transactions. So, if a found block does not manage to get the selected votes\n4\n, the block is simply orphaned by the next block another miner finds.\n\n\nFor a more concrete example, assume the current chain tip is at block 5,000. The voters determined by block 5,000 have already submitted their votes, so miners are chugging away looking for block 5,001. Now, a miner finds a solution for block 5,001 and submits it to the network. All of the daemons (and hence wallets) will see that 5,001 just showed up. However, the miners do not immediately start mining off of 5,001. Instead they continue mining off of 5,000 until 3+ votes for block 5,001 show up. At that point they all switch and start mining off of 5,001. If those 3+ votes never show up, another candidate block 5,001 will be found by the other miners still working on block 5,000 who will submit their (different) solution for block 5,001 to the network. Since each of these new candidate blocks for 5,001 have a different hash, different tickets are selected.\n\n\n\n\n6. What happens if a ticket I have missed a vote?\n\n\nYour wallet will automatically revoke the ticket in the block after it is missed\n5\n, so you get them back just after they were missed as immature funds (that means they will not be spendable for 256 blocks when they mature).\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\ndcrctl --wallet getstakeinfo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nallmempooltix\n\n\nAll of the stake tickets in the memory pool (waiting to be mined into a block).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nownmempooltix\n\n\nYour stake tickets in the memory pool (waiting to be mined into a block).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. What is the difference between a missed and revoked ticket?\n\n\nMissed tickets are tickets that were called to vote, but did not. After a ticket has been missed, it can be revoked\n6\n. The wallet automatically revokes missed tickets it controls (assuming it is unlocked so it can sign the revocation transaction).\n\n\nAll \nrebroadcastmissed\n does is tell wallet to ask the chain server (\ndcrd\n) to give it the list of missed tickets again so it can double check if it needs to revoke any. Typically it is not needed unless, for example, it tried to revoke a ticket but could not because the wallet was not unlocked. In other words, if you noticed that revoked != missed, you might need to \nrebroadcastmissed\n. As said though, there is rarely a need for this since the wallet automatically does it on startup and looks for missed tickets on every block.\n\n\n\n\n Sources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecred Forum, \nPost 7,969\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecred Forum, \nPost 8,965\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecred Forum, \nPost 9,806\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecred Forum, \nPost 10,219\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecred Forum, \nPost 13,912\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecred Forum, \nPost 14,763",

For a more concrete example, assume the current chain tip is at block 5,000. The voters determined by block 5,000 have already submitted their votes, so miners are chugging away looking for block 5,001. Now, a miner finds a solution for block 5,001 and submits it to the network. All of the daemons (and hence wallets) will see that 5,001 just showed up. However, the miners do not immediately start mining off of 5,001. Instead they continue mining off of 5,000 until 3+ votes for block 5,001 show up. At that point they all switch and start mining off of 5,001. If those 3+ votes never show up, another candidate block 5,001 will be found by the other miners still working on block 5,000 who will submit their (different) solution for block 5,001 to the network.

For example, will it have a better chance of winning or anything like that?\n\n\nWell first keep in mind that wallet (\ndcrwallet\n) != core network (\ndcrd\n). In order to stake you need to have \ndcrwallet\n online and unlocked 24/7.\n\n\nWith that out of the way, you are correct that the only real benefit of the current pool is that it will provide worry-free voting since it provides multi-location redundancy and automatic failure recovery\n1\n, neither of which your local setup is very likely to have.\n\n\nHowever, it is entirely possible that a stake pool could implement proportional reward splitting so stakers receive smaller and more consistent payouts, however that would come at the expense of having to trust the pool with the rewards since it would have to receive them in order to split them out (just like with proof-of-work pools).\n\n\n\n\n2. Does a proof-of-stake pool split reward between all participants (% based on the amount of tickets you submitted to pool)?\n\n\nIt is technically possible to create a pool that supports proportional reward splitting\n1\n, but this pool does not do that at all. This one simply votes on your behalf. It does this by making the ticket voting rights a 1-of-2 multi-signature P2SH script. The pool signs the vote with its private key at the time the ticket is selected. Since it is a 1-of-2 multi-signature script though, it means if the pool failed to vote for you for whatever reason (extremely unlikely as the mainnet pool will have multiple redundancy and automatic failover), it would still be possible to vote on your own behalf because you have the second private key and could therefore provide a valid signature and satisfy the 1-of-2 requirement.\n\n\nAlso, it is important to note that the original ticket purchase contains a commitment to go to a reward address for which only you have the private key. The proof-of-stake voting consensus rules enforce the commitment, so it is impossible for the pool to steal your funds.\n\n\nIn order to split rewards the pool would have to be the recipient of all rewards and then be trusted to properly split the rewards amongst all of the participants according to their proportionality. It is expected that such a scheme will be developed with the understanding it is less secure than the approach the current pool design uses.\n\n\n\n\n3. I have to run my wallet to buy tickets, but will they vote properly without me if I shut it down and the pool votes for me instead?\n\n\nYes\n2\n, that is correct. You only need to run wallet in order to spend your coins to purchase the ticket which delegates your voting rights to the pool that will then vote on your behalf. The reward address is a consensus-enforced commitment in the ticket purchase for one of your own addresses for which only you have the private key.\n\n\n\n\n4. Are there any issues that could arise from a stake pool having too many people. For example, force voting a block in or out?\n\n\nIt is certainly possible\n3\n, but one of the things that all pools should support is allowing each user to select their individual voting preferences. That way, whenever their ticket comes up and the pool votes on their behalf, it will vote according to their preferences.\n\n\n\n\n5. Are vote bits set when you purchase a stake or when you actually are called to vote? Does this change when in a proof-of-stake pool?\n\n\nThey are set when you actually vote\n4\n (which really only makes sense because you might have bought the ticket weeks or months before a specific voting agenda even exists).\n\n\nA proof-of-stake pool can operate however it wants since there is a lot of room for flexibility due to the way the ticket purchase commitment scheme is designed. That said, in general, people should avoid using stake pools that do not allow them control over how they want to vote on non-pool specific issues.\n\n\n\n\n6. What safeguards are in place to stop pool owners disappearing with the funds in the pool?\n\n\nThe current pool design is such that the pool can NOT steal the funds\n5\n. You are only delegating voting rights (and in reality it is a 1-of-2 multisig which means either you OR the pool can vote). The ticket purchase contains a consensus-enforced commitment for the final subsidy address, so there is simply no way for the pool to steal the funds.\n\n\nThe worst that would happen if a pool owner disappears is the votes will be missed which results in the ticket being revoked which in turn causes the original coins to go back to the original coin owner (minus the initial transaction fee of course). However, as mentioned previously, because the ticket is a 1-of-2 multisig, each user could run their own wallet in order to vote should the pool owner disappear.\n\n\n\n\n7. Where can I see an example of a stake pool ticket on the block explorer?\n\n\nStake pools involve \nDc\n addresses since the stake pool uses pay-to-script-hash addresses\n6\n. For example, see txid: \nc0abc0ec63a8de15550f067e2b6fde28f0432fb91b938574b282daa69f914103\n.\n\n\n\n\n Sources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecred Forum, \nPost 9,262\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecred Forum, \nPost 9,274\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecred Forum, \nPost 9,311\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecred Forum, \nPost 13,607\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecred Forum, \nPost 14,593\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecred Forum, \nPost 17,515",

Basically what that means is that every reward cycle (see below) the block reward given for mining a block is reduced by approximately 1%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlock reward change\n\n\n6,144 blocks\n\n\nThe number of blocks between block reward changes. This occurs approximately every 3 weeks. Decred uses a more frequent change cycle (about 3 weeks compared to Bitcoins 4 years), but the magnitude of the change is much less (about 1% per cycle whereas Bitcoin is 50%). This is designed to reduce the shock in markets when a change occurs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlock reward share\n\n\n60/30/10\n\n\nThe reward for a block is split between miners and the Decred development team as follows: PoW miners get 60% of the reward to reimburse them for electricity and hardware expenses. PoS miners get 6% of the reward each (30% for 5 votes) \n. This encourages people to hold their coins and invest in the Decred network. The development team receives 10% to help ensure the future of Decred by funding ongoing development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndcrctl parameters\n\n\nChain server commands\n\n\nNote that some commands have been omitted from this list.

Output  Description      poolsize  The number of tickets current in the voting pool.    difficulty  This is the cost of a ticket. It goes up or down depending on the number of tickets currently in the pool as well as the number of tickets over the last 2880 blocks using an exponential moving average  Source(https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/chaincfg/params.go#L336). The network will adjust the price to try to keep the pool size near the target of 40,960 tickets. Note this doesn t mean the price will always go up if above this number, nor will it always go down if below. The rate that tickets enter the pool also affects the price. It is adjusted every 144 blocks.    allmempooltix  Only 20 tickets per block are accepted in to the voting pool. Extra tickets wait in the mempool. Tickets are accepted into the voting pool according to txfee which is 0.05 by default. See PoS mining#Purchasing-Tickets for more information.    ownmempooltix  Your tickets that are waiting in the mempool.    immature  All tickets have a 256 (about a day) maturity time during which they cannot be selected to vote. This indicates how many of your tickets are in this state.    live  Tickets in the voting pool that are active and able to vote when selected.    proportionlive  Proportion of your live tickets in the voting pool.    voted  Number of your tickets that have voted in this wallet.    totalsubsidy  Total amount this wallet has earned through voting.    missed  Tickets that were selected to vote but didn t, likely because the wallet was offline.    proportionmissed  Proportion of all missed tickets that were yours.    revoked  Number of revoked tickets.

This is the height in which the first ticket could possibly mature. Since coins were locked until block 256, no tickets could be purchased until then.

Basically what that means is that every reward cycle (see below) the block reward given for mining a block is reduced by approximately 1%.    Block reward change  6,144 blocks  The number of blocks between block reward changes. This occurs approximately every 3 weeks. Decred uses a more frequent change cycle (about 3 weeks compared to Bitcoins 4 years), but the magnitude of the change is much less (about 1% per cycle whereas Bitcoin is 50%). This is designed to reduce the shock in markets when a change occurs.    Block reward share  60/30/10  The reward for a block is split between miners and the Decred development team as follows: PoW miners get 60% of the reward to reimburse them for electricity and hardware expenses. PoS miners get 6% of the reward each (30% for 5 votes)  . This encourages people to hold their coins and invest in the Decred network.

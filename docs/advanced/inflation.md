New blocks are discovered by the proof-of-work miners roughly every 5 minutes, and each time this occurs new decred are created.  This block reward is split three ways:

* 60% goes to the PoW miner who found the block
* 30% goes to the PoS voters on that block (6% to each of the 5 voters)
* 10% goes towards the development subsidy

The block reward started at 31.19582664 and it adjusts every 6,144 blocks (approximately 21.33 days) by reducing by a factor of 100/101[^1].

If a block includes less than 5 PoS votes there will be a fraction of the block reward which is not allocated to anybody. As a result, it is only possible to calculate an upper limit for the total number of decred which will ever be created.

> The last block reward will be created in September 2120. The upper limit on the total supply of Decred is 20,999,999.99800912 coins[^2].

The following chart shows an estimate of the coin supply growth over time.

![Decred supply chart](../../img/decred_supply.png)

The table below shows the estimated block reward and estimated total supply of Decred up to block 2,457,600 in 2039. Note that the total supply of DCR at block 1 is 1,680,000 due to the [premine](/faq/general.md#3-how-was-the-decred-premine-distributed). PoS voting started at block 4,096[^3] therefore PoS rewards were not generated before that height.

Block height | Estimated date     | Block reward (DCR) | PoW (DCR)    | PoS vote (DCR) | Dev subsidy (DCR) | Total DCR supply

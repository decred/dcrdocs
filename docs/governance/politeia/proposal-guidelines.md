---

The page provides a basic [proposal template](#proposal-template) and
[tips for creating a successful proposal](#tips-for-creating-a-successful-proposal).
See the [example proposals](../../governance/politeia/example-proposals.md) page for
example proposals that use this template.


## Proposal Template

All proposals should answer the following questions:

### What

In the *What* section, provide a short description of the problem that will 
be addressed.

### Why

In the *Why* section, answer why the proposal is needed and why it is
a good idea.

### How

In the *How* section, describe the steps you will perform to accomplish your
goals.

### Who

In the *Who* section, describe the entity that will 
complete the work and draw down on the proposal's budget.

### When

In the *When* section, describe the project's milestones, expected 
completion dates, and the draw schedule (how much DCR is paid for each milestone achieved).

## Tips for Creating a Successful Proposal

Following the below tips will greatly increase your proposal's chance of success. 

#### Engage the community

Engaging with the [community](../../getting-started/beginner-guide.md#community) first, 
before submitting a proposal, will allow you to gague interest in your idea, gather 
feedback, and better understand your proposal's chance of success before investing time
in a proposal. 

#### Demonstrate clearly how your proposal will benefit Decred

Do not submit personal ventures, business ideas
or experimentation, unless it clearly benefits the project.
Explain how your proposal will directly further the project's aims, and provide
clear deliverables and milestones. 

#### Check the hype

Many Decred stakeholders are highly technical veterans in the 
blockchain space. Over-hyped, buzzword-filled proposals without substance will likely be
ignored. Be precise in your use of technical terms, realistic in your projections, 
and bring your A game in the comments.

#### Build Credibility

The bigger the proposal, the more you will need to convince stakeholders you 
are capable of doing what you propose. If you are unknown to the community, showcase past 
contributions to other projects (bonus points for verifiable open-source contributions). 
If your plan requires working with current Decred contractors,
be sure to communicate with them beforehand and secure their support. If you're looking to
build credibility within the community before submitting a proposal (a good strategy), 
you will find the Decred project very welcoming to contributors of all levels. Start small, 
deliver, and your chances of submitting a successful proposal will increase along with your
credibility.

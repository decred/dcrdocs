`dcrlncli closeallchannels` - Close all existing channels.

### Usage
```
   dcrlncli closeallchannels [command options] [arguments...]
```

### Description

Close all existing channels.

Channels will be closed either cooperatively or unilaterally, depending
on whether the channel is active or not. If the channel is inactive, any
settled funds within it will be time locked for a few blocks before they
can be spent.

One can request to close inactive channels only by using the
`--inactive_only` flag.

By default, one is prompted for confirmation every time an inactive
channel is requested to be closed. To avoid this, one can set the
`--force` flag, which will only prompt for confirmation once for all
inactive channels and proceed to close them.

In the case of cooperative closures, one can manually set the fee to
be used for the closing transactions via either the `--conf_target` or
`--atoms_per_byte` arguments. This will be the starting value used during
fee negotiation. This is optional.

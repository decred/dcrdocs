## Welcome To Decred

This guide offers signposts to some useful resources, including how to set up your Decred wallet, buy DCR, participate in Decred’s governance, connect with the community and contribute to the project (contributors welcome!).

## Wallets

[Decrediton](../wallets/decrediton/decrediton-setup.md) is Decred's GUI wallet
for Windows, MacOS and Linux.
It supports voting through [Voting Service Providers](https://decred.org/vsp/)
and offers the easiest way to start buying tickets and participating in
governance.

There is also a [Command Line Interface (CLI)](../wallets/cli/cli-installation.md) for
Windows, MacOS and Linux.
The CLI exposes more advanced functionality, including the ability to run a
personal voting wallet.

Decred is supported by [Trezor](https://trezor.io/) and
[Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/), two popular
[hardware wallet](../wallets/hardware-wallets.md) implementations.

[Mobile wallets](../wallets/mobile-wallets.md) for Android and iOS are also
available.
To minimize data plan, processing power and storage requirements, the mobile
wallets make use of [SPV mode](../wallets/spv.md).

See the [developer documentation](https://devdocs.decred.org/) for more information on various projects, technical documentation and developer-specific contribution guidelines.

### Contributing

Decred is always looking for new contributors. A basic outline of how this works is: Show up, Find something useful to do, Do it, Get Paid. Do a small bit at first and see if other contributors in that domain appreciate it. For details, see  [contributing to Decred](../contributing/overview.md).

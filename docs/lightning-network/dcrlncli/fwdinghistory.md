`dcrlncli fwdinghistory` - Query the history of all forwarded HTLCs.

### Usage
```
   dcrlncli fwdinghistory [command options] start_time [end_time] [index_offset] [max_events]
```

### Description

Query the HTLC switch's internal forwarding log for all completed
payment circuits (HTLCs) over a particular time range `--start_time` and
`--end_time`. The start and end times are meant to be expressed in
seconds since the Unix epoch. If `--start_time` isn't provided,
then 24 hours ago is used.  If `--end_time` isn't provided,
then the current time is used.

The max number of events returned is 50k. The default number is 100,
callers can use the `--max_events` param to modify this value.

Finally, callers can skip a series of events using the `--index_offset`
parameter. Each response will contain the offset index of the last
entry. Using this callers can manually paginate within a time slice.

### Options
|Option|Info|
|--|--|
|`--start_time value`|    the starting time for the query, expressed in seconds since the unix epoch (default: 0)|
|`--end_time value`|      the end time for the query, expressed in seconds since the unix epoch (default: 0)|
|`--index_offset value`|  the number of events to skip (default: 0)|

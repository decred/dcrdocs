Distributed timestamping protocols were first applied to decentralizing a financial network in the ground-breaking paper on Bitcoin by Nakamoto[^1]. The field has seen explosive research follow-up from both amateurs and professionals, competing to offer extensions, adjustments, improvements, and refinements of the existing protocol. Notable implementations of new ideas include Ethereum[^2], which extended scripting, CryptoNote[^3], which refined privacy, and Sidechains[^4], which investigated two-way pegs with 1:1 Bitcoin tokens. These protocols all utilize proof-of-work (PoW) as originally described in the Bitcoin whitepaper.

A common extension to the Bitcoin protocol modifies the consensus mechanism to either completely or partially use proof-of-stake (PoS), or the use of one's stake (tokens) rather than one's computational power to participate in the timestamping process. The first proof-of-stake blockchain based on the Bitcoin protocol was implemented in 2012 by King and Nadal[^5], and includes both PoW and PoS that gradually skew towards complete PoS over time. Criticisms of pure PoS consensus systems have themselves been abundant[^6] [^7], with the most vehement opposition coming from those working with purely PoW blockchains. The most common argument against PoS for distributed timestamping is "nothing-at-stake" or "costless simulation", describing the systematic instability resulting from stakeholders being able to generate alternatively timestamped histories with no cost to themselves.

Despite the controversy, it is apparent that systems with a PoS overlay dependent on a PoW timestamping system may be able to independently achieve consensus. This is mathematically explored by Bentov and colleagues[^8] in a paper on their scheme, proof-of-activity (PoA), and appears to be a viable extension to the PoW protocols that may enable some interesting new properties. A similar design called MC2 was earlier proposed by Mackenzie in 2013[^9]. Here we describe the construction and implementation of a similar consensus system that we have named "Decred".

Research work in Decred is currently organized around the following subsections:

* [Hybrid Design](hybrid-design.md)
* [Decentralized Stake Pooling](decentralized-stake-pooling.md)
* [Elliptic Curve Signature Algorithms](elliptic-curve-signature-algorithms.md)
* [BLAKE-256 Hash Function](blake-256-hash-function.md)
* [Script Extensions](script-extensions.md)
* [Signature Script Isolation and Fraud Proofs](signature-script-isolation-and-fraud-proofs.md)
* [Transaction Extensions](https://devdocs.decred.org/developer-guides/transactions/transaction-extensions/)
* [Schnorr Signatures](schnorr-signatures.md)
* [Miscellaneous Improvements](miscellaneous-improvements.md)

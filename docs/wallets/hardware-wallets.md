# <img class="dcr-icon" src="/img/dcr-icons/Wallet.svg" /> Hardware Wallets

A hardware wallet is a device that stores your private keys on a secure piece of hardware, instead
of in a file on your computer, as is done with [Decrediton](../decrediton/decrediton-setup/) and other software wallets. Hardware wallets provide an additional level of security, and are generally considered more secure than software wallets.

Here are the hardware wallets that support Decred (last updated 2019-10-22).

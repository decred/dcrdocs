## <img class="dcr-icon" src="/img/dcr-icons/RFP.svg" /> Request for Proposals (RFP)

Decred was launched with a Request For Proposal system in order to provide compensation for contributors working on larger or more significant projects. A document (RFP) would be produced which described the requirements and scope of a project, along with a clearly defined set of milestones and a reward specified in DCR. The RFP would be posted publicly and community members would be given a period of time to submit their proposals. After review, a proposal would be selected and awarded the contract.

The RFPs were stored on GitHub and they can still be viewed. The first, [RFP-001](https://github.com/decred/RFPs/blob/master/rfp-0001/rfp-0001.md), was looking for developers to overhaul the Paymetheus application. RFP progress and payments were made public via the Decred forum[^1].

The RFP process worked well for certain types of tasks, however a need arose to have contributors engaged and compensated over the longer term and on a more flexible basis[^2]. In January 2017 the RFP system was changed to a contractor model and Decred began to hire it's first contractors.

Decred currently has over 20 active contractors and they can be viewed on the decred.org [Contributors](https://decred.org/contributors) page. The active contractors are made up of both individuals and corporate contractors. Contractors contribute in a wide variety of ways including software development, design, marketing, community management and documentation.

Contractors submit a monthly invoice to DHG (Decred Holding Group) and are paid in Decred according to an hourly rate.

A hardware wallet is a device that stores your private keys on a secure piece of hardware, instead
of in a file on your computer, as is done with [Decrediton](../decrediton/decrediton-setup/) and other software wallets. Hardware wallets provide an additional level of security, and are generally considered more secure than software wallets.

Below is a table of hardware wallets that support Decred (last updated 2019-08-31).

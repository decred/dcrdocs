# Οδηγός Ρύθμισης του Decrediton

Η τελευταία ενημέρωση έγινε για την έκδοση v1.0.0

---

`Decrediton` is a graphical user interface for `dcrwallet`. When this application launches, it automatically starts its own instance of `dcrd` and `dcrwallet` in the background - it will not open if there is already a running instance of `dcrd`.

NOTE: If at any point the program becomes unresponsive or gets stuck on a loading screen, this can usually be fixed with a restart of the application.

## Λήψη και Εγκατάσταση

Decrediton is released with the Binary Releases and can be found here: [https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.1.0](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.1.0). As of v1.1.0, Decrediton is only available for Linux and macOS.

> macOS

1. Download the `decrediton-1.1.0.dmg` file.

2. Double click the `decrediton-1.1.0.dmg` file once downloaded to mount the disk image.

3. Drag the decrediton.app into the link to your Applications folder within the disk image.

> Linux

1. Download the `decrediton-1.1.0.tar.gz` file.

2. Navigate to download location and extract the .tar.gz file:

    Ubuntu File Browser: simply right click on the .tar.gz file and press "Extract Here". <br />
    Terminal: use the `tar -xvzf filename.tar.gz` command.

    Both of these should extract the tar.gz into a folder that shares the same name. (`e.g. tar -xvzf decrediton-v1.1.0.tar.gz` should extract to `decrediton-v1.1.0`). If successful, this new folder should include a `decrediton` executable.

## Κρίσιμες Πληροφορίες

During the creation process for your wallet, you will be given a sequence of 33 words known as a seed phrase. This seed phrase is essentially the private key for your wallet. You will be able to use this seed phrase to restore your private keys, transaction history, and balances using any Decred wallet on any computer. 

This ultimately means that *anyone* who knows your seed can use it to restore your private keys, transaction history, and balances to a Decred wallet on their computer without your knowledge. For this reason, it is of utmost importance to keep your seed phrase safe. Treat this seed the same way you would treat a physical key to a safe. If you lose your seed phrase, you permanently lose access to your wallet and all funds within it. It cannot be recovered by anyone, including the Decred developers. It is recommended you write it down on paper and store that somewhere secure. If you decide to keep it on your computer, it would be best to keep it in an encrypted document (do not forget the password) in case the file or your computer is stolen.

After clicking "OK, I Understand" to the disclaimer, you'll see the "Create a Wallet" dialog.

The "Create a Wallet" dialog defaults to the "New Seed" option. Simply click "Existing Seed" if you already have a seed you intend to use, and follow the steps presented there. This guide assumes you do not have a seed and will continue using the "New Seed" option. Please review the [Critical Information](#critical-information) about seeds, above.

1. Record the seed that is displayed in the text box (you will need to re-enter it on the next screen).

2. Πατήστε "Συνέχεια"

3. Confirm your seed, and create a private wallet passphrase. This passphrase will be used to unlock your wallet when creating transactions.

4. Πατήστε "Δημιουργία Πορτοφολιού"

5. You should then see a spinning blue circle. This will spin until `dcrd` has fully synced the blockchain. On computers that haven't had `dcrd` loaded on them, this should take 1-2 hours with newer hardware (it may take longer with older hardware). You can check your process monitor application for a running instance of `dcrd` - if it is using a substantial percentage of your CPU, it is syncing. If it isn't, Decrediton may require a restart to move beyond this screen.

## Άνοιγμα του Πορτοφολιού

After the blockchain has been synced, you should see an "Opening Wallet" page. Here, you will need to enter your private passphrase and the wallet will rescan recent blocks for transactions that belong to your addresses. Wait for the progress bar to fill. Decrediton should then load the Overview page with your Available Balance and Recent Transactions displayed.

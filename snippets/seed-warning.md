    During the creation process for your wallet, you will be given a sequence of 33
    words known as a seed phrase. This seed phrase is essentially the private key
    for your wallet. You will be able to use this seed phrase to restore your
    private keys, transaction history, and balances using any Decred wallet on any
    computer.

    This ultimately means that *anyone* who knows your seed can use it to restore
    your private keys, transaction history, and balances to a Decred wallet on their
    computer without your knowledge. For this reason, it is of utmost importance to
    keep your seed phrase safe. Treat this seed the same way you would treat a
    physical key to a safe. If you lose your seed phrase, you permanently lose
    access to your wallet and all funds within it. It cannot be recovered by anyone,
    including the Decred developers. It is recommended you write it down on paper
    and store that somewhere secure. If you decide to keep it on your computer, it
    would be best to keep it in an encrypted document (do not forget the password)
    in case the file or your computer is stolen.

    Every seed phrase is also associated with a 64 character seed hex. The seed hex
    functions the same way as the seed phrase, so it is also important to keep your
    seed hex secure.

    **DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, GIVE YOUR SEED OR THE ASSOCIATED HEX KEY TO
    ANYONE! NOT EVEN DECRED DEVELOPERS!**

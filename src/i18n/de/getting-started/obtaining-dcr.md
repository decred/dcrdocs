## <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Overview

This article discusses some of the ways a user can acquire Decred
coins.

The five basic ways are:

* Purchase Decred for BTC Through an Exchange
* PoW Mine for Decred
* PoS Mine for Decred (this requires you to already have some Decred)
* Contribute to Decred
* Sell / Trade Goods or Services with someone who already has Decred.

## <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Purchasing Decred

One way to acquire Decred is to purchase some on an exchange.

### <i class="fa fa-btc"></i> Bitcoin

Note: Due to Decredâ€™s early stages of development and adoption,
Bitcoin must be traded for Decred, fiat currency cannot be used.  If
you already have some Bitcoin, move ahead to the next section.  If you
do not have any Bitcoin, the procedure for obtaining some has been
well documented in the
[Bitcoin wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Buying_Bitcoins_%28the_newbie_version%29).

### <i class="fa fa-exchange"></i> Exchanges

Since the release of Decred on February 8th, 2016, there are four
currency exchanges where you can buy or sell Decred (as of February 2017).
We hope this list will grow as time goes on.

* [Poloniex](https://poloniex.com/)
* [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/)
* [Bleutrade](https://bleutrade.com/exchange)
* [Tux Exchange](https://tuxexchange.com)

You will need to create an account on one of these sites, send your
Bitcoin to this new account, and submit an order for Decred at a price
of your choosing.  When your order is fulfilled, you will need to
withdraw your new Decred and send it to your Decred wallet.

## <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Direct Exchanges

As Decred continues to grow in popularity, some exchanges are offering
Decred directly for fiat currency.

Proof-of-Work (PoW) is a measure of using computational power to
create and verify the cryptographically secure blockchain.  This is
similar to traditional Bitcoin mining.  PoW mining is described in
more detail [here](/mining/proof-of-work).

## <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Stake Mine for Decred / Proof-of-Stake (PoS)

Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mining is performed by stakeholders who lock a
certain amount of their DCR in return for voting rights and a monetary
reward. PoS mining is described in more detail
[here](/mining/proof-of-stake).

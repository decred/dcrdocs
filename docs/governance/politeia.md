# <img class="dcr-icon" src="/img/dcr-icons/UserProjects.svg" /> Politeia

Politeia (Pi for short) is the Decred proposal system: a platform developed to give stakeholders sovereignty over Decred's development through an open, immutable, and censorship resistant web application.

## Proposals

Pi users may submit proposals to poll ticketholder support for a specific idea or action such as:

* **Determining the Decred roadmap.**
* **Amending the Decred Constitution.**
* **Creating a budget for a project to be paid for through the Decred Treasury.**


Pi is an open proposal system meaning anyone on the internet can create an account and submit a proposal for Decred ticketholder consideration.

## Spam Resistance

Since Pi is open it is likely to attract spam.

To resist spam there are two fees a user must pay to participate:

1. **Account creation fee** (0.1DCR) - A one time fee that must be paid when registering an account on Pi.
1. **Proposal submission fee**(0.1DCR) - A fee that must be paid when submitting a proposal.

!!! info ""
    Fees are subject to change based on their effectiveness at discouraging spam and/or change in DCR price.

To provide a second layer of defense against spam, all submitted proposals are reviewed by human administrators.

## Transparent Censorship 

Pi was developed to eliminate the threat of silent censorship through a 100% transparent censorship process.

When a user submits a proposal for review, they receive a **censorship token**: an immutable record of a users proposal submission.

Censorship tokens are tied to the cryptographic identity of the submitter of its corresponding proposal and may be used as cryptographic verification of censorship.

!!! info "Cryptographic Identity"
    All Pi users receive a cryptographic identity (pub/priv key pair) specific to their browser.
    It is important to verify your Pi account in the same browser that you used to register. After successful account verification your identity can be imported into a different browser.

## Data Immutability

All data generated through Pi is stored off-chain but made cryptographically verifiable through **chain-anchoring**. Leveraging the power of git and dcrTime, hashes of changes to the governance data generated by git are periodically anchored into the blockchain through a dcrTime server, creating a cryptographic timestamped record.

Chain-anchoring allows the creation of a immutable record of Pi Governance without the need for large amounts of on-chain storage.

All Pi data is made immutable to ensure Governance conducted on the platform is resistant to manipulation.

## The Proposal Process

The stages a proposal will go through from submission to voted are as follows:

1. **Review** - Once  proposals are submitted they are reviewed by Pi admins. If a proposal is determined to be spam, it is censored. All acceptable proposals are released for public consideration. 
1. **Discussion** - Once released, proposals are discussed by the community through proposal comments. During this stage proposals may be edited in response to community feedback.
1. **Voting** - Once ready, the proposal writer invokes the voting phase. Ticketholder votes on whether to approve or deny the proposal are collected over a 1 week period. If approved by a majority vote, the actions outlined by the proposal may be performed.

    Pi is a step toward fully decentralizing the governance of Decred's development. Currently, Pi serves as a signaling mechanism from stakeholders to the trusted humans in control of the Decred Treasury wallet (Decred Holdings Group). True decentralization is planned for the future through relinquishment of control of the Decred Treasury to a DAE (Decentralized Autonomous Entity).

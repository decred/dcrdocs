There are five methods for downloading and installing the Decred software. 

* [The Windows Installer](#paymetheus) (.msi) - This only works for installing Paymetheus on Windows machines.
* [dcrinstall](#dcrinstall) - A cross-platform, automatic installer/updater for the command-line applications (`dcrd`, `dcrwallet`, and `dcrctl`).
* [Decrediton](#decrediton) - For installing decrediton on Linux or Mac.
* Manually installing and setting up the precompiled [binary releases](#binary-releases) for the cross-platform command-line applications.
* Compiling from source.

The first four methods will be covered here and the fifth may be added at a later date.

!!! warning "Warning"

    When you register with a VSP, it is essential to backup your "[redeem
    script](/proof-of-stake/redeem-script)". Only you and your VSP know the
    redeem script, and it must be backed up to ensure you don't end up with
    locked funds. If your VSP goes down, you'll need the script to vote or
    revoke tickets.

    Lost scripts which have been used at least once to vote or revoke tickets [can
    be recovered](/proof-of-stake/redeem-script#recovery-methods).

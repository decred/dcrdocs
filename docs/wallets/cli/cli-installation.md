Last updated for CLI release v{{ cliversion }}.

---

`dcrinstall` is the recommended method to install the Decred command line interface tools `dcrd`, `dcrwallet`, and `dcrctl`.

`dcrinstall` is an automatic installer and upgrader for the Decred software. The newest release can be found here: <https://github.com/decred/decred-release/releases>. Binaries are provided for Windows, macOS and Linux.

`dcrinstall` will automatically download the precompiled, signed binary package found on GitHub, verify the signature of this package, copy the binaries within the package to a specific folder dependent on OS, create configuration files with settings to allow the 3 applications to communicate with each other, and run you through the wallet creation process. After running through `dcrinstall`, you will be able to launch the software with no additional configuration.

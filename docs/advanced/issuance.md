New blocks are discovered by the proof-of-work miners roughly every 5 minutes, and each time this occurs new decred are created. For the first 657,279 blocks, the block reward was split three ways:

* 60% went to the PoW miner who found the block
* 30% went to the PoS voters on that block (6% to each of the 5 voters)
* 10% went towards the Decred Treasury

This PoS reward was designed to encourage people to stake their coins and provide the valuable service of approving blocks on the network, but not allow PoS voters who were early adopters to gain or retain a dominant share over time due to the higher early coin emission rate simply by staking. PoW miners received a greater share of the reward than PoS voters to compensate them for securing the network early on and to encourage a broader distribution of the monetary supply during the bulk of the initial coin distribution phase. The 10% block reward to the Decred Treasury helps to ensure the future of Decred by creating a sustainable source of funding for development.

As of block 657,280, the block reward is split three ways:

* 10% goes to the PoW miner who found the block
* 80% goes to the PoS voters on that block (16% to each of the 5 voters)
* 10% goes towards the Decred Treasury

Taking into account the initial block reward split for the first 657,279 blocks and the modified split starting with block 657,280, the effective final split of the total mined coins is:

* 42.84% to PoW miners
* 47.14% to PoS voters
* 10% to the Decred Treasury

The block reward started at 31.19582664 and it adjusts every 6,144 blocks (approximately 21.33 days) by reducing by a factor of 100/101[^1].

If a block includes less than 5 PoS votes there will be a fraction of the block reward which is not allocated to anybody. As a result, it is only possible to calculate an upper limit for the total number of decred which will ever be created.

> The last block reward will be created in September 2120. The upper limit on the total supply of Decred is 21,000,000.00015952 coins[^2].

The hard cap with no “tail emissions” beyond the scheduled ~21M is designed to provide certainty in the monetary policy and prevent existing holders from being diluted by future manipulation of the monetary supply.

The following chart shows an estimate of the coin supply growth over time.

The table below shows the estimated block reward and estimated total supply of Decred up to block 2,457,600 in 2039. Note that the total supply of DCR at block 1 is 1,680,000 due to the [premine](premine.md). There was no block reward for proof-of-work miners in block 1, which allowed miners to voluntarily choose whether or not to accept the terms of the airdrop independent of a potential reward which could skew the incentive. PoS voting started at block 4,096[^3] therefore PoS rewards were not generated before that height.

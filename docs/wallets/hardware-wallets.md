# <img class="dcr-icon" src="/img/dcr-icons/Wallet.svg" /> Hardware Wallets

A hardware wallet is a device that stores your private keys on a secure piece of hardware, instead
of in a file on your computer, as is done with [Decrediton](../decrediton/decrediton-setup/) and other software wallets. Hardware wallets
are generally considered much more secure than software wallets, and easier to use than paper wallets. It is generally 
recommended that anyone self-custodying significant amounts of crypto not keep it on an exchange or software 
wallet, but in a hardware wallet or using another more secure method. 

Decred is currently supported on two hardware wallets:

- [Trezor](https://trezor.io/)
- [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/)

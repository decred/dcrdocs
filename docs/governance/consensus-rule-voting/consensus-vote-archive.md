### Start Lightning Network Support

**Agenda ID:**  lnsupport

Request developers begin work on Lightning Network (LN) integration

The Lightning Network is the most directly useful application of smart contracts to date since it allows for off-chain transactions that optionally settle on-chain. This infrastructure has clear benefits for both scaling and privacy. Decred is optimally positioned for this integration.

## V5

### Activation of new opcodes for Lightning Network Support

**Agenda ID:** lnfeatures

Enable features defined in [DCP0002](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0002/dcp-0002.mediawiki) and [DCP0003](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0003/dcp-0003.mediawiki) necessary to support Lightning Network (LN)

The Lightning Network is the most directly useful application of smart contracts to date since it allows for off-chain transactions that optionally settle on-chain. This infrastructure has clear benefits for both scaling and privacy. Decred is optimally positioned for this integration.

Block 205189 is the first block which contains the new opcode which was voted in via the lnfeatures vote and thus all old nodes must upgrade.

# Inflation

New blocks are discovered by the PoW miners roughly every 5 minutes, and each time this occurs new decred are created.  This "block reward" is split three ways:

* 60% goes to the proof of work miner who found the block
* 30% goes to the PoS voters on that block (6% to each of the 5 voters)
* 10% goes towards the development subsidy

The block reward started at 31.19582664 and it adjusts every 6,144 blocks (approximately 21.33 days) by reducing by a factor of 100/101.

If a block includes less than 5 PoS votes there will be a fraction of the block reward which is not allocated to anybody. As a result, it is only possible to calculate an upper limit for the total number of Decred which will ever be created.

> The last block reward will be created in January 2039. The upper limit on the total supply of Decred at this time is 20,999,999.99800912 coins.

The following chart shows an estimate of the coin supply growth over time.

The table below shows the estimated block reward and estimated total supply of Decred until the last block reward in 2039. Note that the total supply of DCR at block 0 is 1,680,000 due to the [premine](/faq/general.md#3-how-was-the-decred-premine-distributed).

Block height | Estimated Date       | Block reward (DCR) | PoW (DCR) | PoS vote (DCR) | Dev subsidy (DCR) | Total DCR supply

# The Golden Path

Welcome to the world of Decred! We know that getting started with any new cryptocurrency
can be difficult and we want to make the journey as easy as possible. Decred is well
documented, with everything from basic information such as, "how do I send decred", to
super technical stuff like "why did you choose a BLAKE-256 hash function, and how does
it compare to the Merkle-Damg√•rd construction?".

So that you don't get overwhelmed by the amount of information available, we have created
a "Golden Path" through the documentation that will take you through the basics of getting
started with Decred, information on how to participate in the voting and mining processes
then finish with advanced options and how to participate in the test network for those
who are interested. 

Each document in the path will lead to the next so have a look at the bottom of the page
for the 'Continue to ...' link to keep going.

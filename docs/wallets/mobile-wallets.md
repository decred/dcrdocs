# <img class="dcr-icon" src="/img/dcr-icons/Wallet.svg" /> Mobile Wallets

Mobile Decred wallets are available for both
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.decred.dcrandroid.mainnet)
and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/decred-wallet/id1462247643).

Unlike desktop wallets, the mobile wallets do not download and validate the
entire Decred blockchain.
Instead, they run using [SPV mode](spv.md), which drastically decreases the use
of the mobile devices system resources and data plan.

It is not currently possible to participate in Proof-of-Stake using mobile
wallets.

Both of the mobile wallets are maintained by
[planetdecred.org](https://planetdecred.org) developers.

## Upgrading steps

1. Downlaod latest version. The latest downloads can be found at [https://decred.org/downloads/](https://decred.org/downloads/)
or by clicking on the `Update Available` button in the upper right-hand corner of Decrediton.

2. Close your current version of Decrediton (if open) and click on the downloaded installer. Follow the installation instructions as you would for any other program. 
3. Open Decrediton. Note that when upgrading, Decrediton will need to re-download the entire Decred blockchain the first time you open it, which can take several minutes.
4. Click on the `Governance` tab to check for new Politeia proposals and consensus rule changes. Upgraded versions of Decredition may contain latent consensus rule changes that will be automatically enabled if stakeholders vote to accept them. For more on voting, see the governance section of the [Using Decredition](../wallets/decrediton/using-decrediton/#governance) page.

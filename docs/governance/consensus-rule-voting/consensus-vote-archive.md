### Update Sequence Lock Rules

Agenda ID: [fixlnseqlocks](https://dcrdata.decred.org/agenda/fixlnseqlocks)

**Modify sequence lock handling as defined in [DCP-0004](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0004/dcp-0004.mediawiki)**

In order to fully support the Lightning Network, the current sequence lock consensus rules need to be modified.

### Activation of new opcodes for Lightning Network Support

Agenda ID: [lnfeatures](https://dcrdata.decred.org/agenda/lnfeatures)

**Enable features defined in [DCP-0002](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0002/dcp-0002.mediawiki) and [DCP-0003](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0003/dcp-0003.mediawiki) necessary to support Lightning Network (LN)**

The Lightning Network is the most directly useful application of smart contracts to date since it allows for off-chain transactions that optionally settle on-chain. This infrastructure has clear benefits for both scaling and privacy. Decred is optimally positioned for this integration.

Block 205189 is the first block which contains the new opcode which was voted in via the lnfeatures vote and thus all old nodes must upgrade.

### Start Lightning Network Support

Agenda ID: [lnsupport](https://dcrdata.decred.org/agenda/lnsupport)

**Request developers begin work on Lightning Network (LN) integration**

The Lightning Network is the most directly useful application of smart contracts to date since it allows for off-chain transactions that optionally settle on-chain. This infrastructure has clear benefits for both scaling and privacy. Decred is optimally positioned for this integration.

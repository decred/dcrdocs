---

Aside from the previously mentioned OP_CHECKSIGALT and OP_CHECKSIGALTVERIFY, other modifications to Bitcoin scripting have been made. A version byte has been added to output scripts to enable simple soft forking to new scripting languages, as first suggested by Wuille[^1]. All math and logic related OP codes have been re-enabled and now operate on int32 registers. Various byte string manipulation OP codes have also been implemented and re-enabled. The remaining unused Bitcoin OP codes have been repurposed for future soft forks. Some longstanding bugs in the Bitcoin scripting language have been also been fixed[^2] [^3].

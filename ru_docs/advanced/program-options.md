# **Program Options**

---

The default options are sane for most users (although you may need to
set your credentials. This means `dcrd` will
work 'out of the box' for most users. However, there are also a wide
variety of flags that can be used to control its behavior. The following section
provides a usage overview which enumerates the flags.An interesting
point to note is that the long form of all of these options (except
`-C`) can be specified in a configuration file that is automatically
parsed when dcrd starts up.
The `-C` (`--configfile`)
flag, as shown below, can be used to override the default location.
You can always get a list of all options by using the `-h` option.

## **PoS Commands**

While it's easy to get started PoS mining, there's a lot happening in
the background. Let's have a look at some of the information
available:

```
dcrctl -u <daemon username> - P <daemon password> --wallet <command>
```

```getbalance ("account" minconf=1 "balancetype")``` Gets the balance
for the given account (not address). On its own it will display
spendable coins. To see all coins, you need to set balancetype to all
e.g. â€˜getbalance * 0 all' will show the total balance in wallet.

```
getstakeinfo
  "poolsize": 42208,
  "difficulty": 17.4973371,
  "allmempooltix": 0,
  "ownmempooltix": 0,
  "immature": 0,
  "live": 213,
  "proportionlive": 0.005046436694465504,
  "voted": 129,
  "totalsubsidy": 239.06504718,
  "missed": 50,
  "proportionmissed": 0.0011832079132945241,
  "revoked": 50
```

The `getstakeinfo` command returns a list of data about your PoS mining results.

Output             | Description
---                |---
`poolsize`         | The number of tickets current in the voting pool.
`difficulty`       | This is the cost of a ticket. It goes up or down depending on the number of tickets currently in the pool as well as the number of tickets over the last 2880 blocks using an exponential moving average <LINK>Source(https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/chaincfg/params.go#L336). The network will adjust the price to try to keep the pool size near the target of 40,960 tickets. Note this doesn't mean the price will always go up if above this number, nor will it always go down if below. The rate that tickets enter the pool also affects the price. It is adjusted every 144 blocks.
`allmempooltix`    | Only 20 tickets per block are accepted in to the voting pool. Extra tickets wait in the mempool. Tickets are accepted into the voting pool according to txfee which is 0.05 by default. See PoS mining#Purchasing-Tickets for more information.
`ownmempooltix`    | Your tickets that are waiting in the mempool.
`immature`         | All tickets have a 256 (about a day) maturity time during which they cannot be selected to vote. This indicates how many of your tickets are in this state.
`live`             | Tickets in the voting pool that are active and able to vote when selected.
`proportionlive`   | Proportion of your live tickets in the voting pool.
`voted`            | Number of your tickets that have voted in this wallet.
`totalsubsidy`     | Total amount this wallet has earned through voting.
`missed`           | Tickets that were selected to vote but didn't, likely because the wallet was offline.
`proportionmissed` | Proportion of all missed tickets that were yours.
`revoked`          | Number of revoked tickets. Since missed tickets are revoked (removed from the voting pool without voting) this number will usually (but not always) equal missed tickets.

## **PoS network parameters**

Parameter               | Value              | Description
---                     | ---                | ---
`MinimumStakeDiff`      | 2                  | The minimum price for a stake ticket.
`TicketPoolSize`        | 8,192              | This is multiplied by TicketsPerBlock to get the desired voting pool size (40,960).
`TicketsPerBlock`       | 5                  | This many tickets will be chosen to vote each block.
`TicketMaturity`        | 256                | Time in blocks (about a day) until a ticket is able to vote after being purchased.
`TicketExpiry`          | 40,960             | Tickets that haven't voted after this many blocks will be revoked (about 142 days).
`CoinbaseMaturity`      | 256                | Historic. Before this block coins could not be transferred.
`SStxChangeMaturity`    | 1                  | After voting, this many blocks must pass for stake and reward to return to PoS miners.
`TicketPoolSizeWeight`  | 4                  | Tickets will not change price up or down by more than this multiplier in one update.
`StakeDiffAlpha`        | 1                  | This is the stake difficulty EMA calculation alpha (smoothing) value. It is different from a normal EMA alpha. Closer to 1 --> smoother.
`StakeDiffWindowSize`   | 144                | The number of blocks in a window. Averaged per window, used below.
`StakeDiffWindows`      | 20                 | An exponential moving average over this many windows is used to calculate stake cost.
`MaxFreshStakePerBlock` | 20                 | This many new tickets will be added from the mempool to the voting pool each block.
`StakeEnabledHeight`    | 256 + 256          | Historic. This is the height in which the first ticket could possibly mature. Since coins were locked until block 256, no tickets could be purchased until then. After that, there was another 256 blocks before they matured.
`StakeValidationHeight` | 4,096              | Historic. Stake mining did not occur before this block.
`StakeBaseSigScript`    | []byte{0x00, 0x00} | This is the consensus stakebase signature script for all votes on the network. This isn't signed in any way, so without forcing it to be this value, miners/daemons could freely change it. Ensures the block is on the right network.

## **Blockchain parameters**

Paramater               | Value        | Description
---                     | ---          | ---
Initial block reward    | 31.1958      | This was the initial reward for mining a block.
Block reward multiplier | 100/101      | The block reward is multiplied by this whenever the block price changes. Basically what that means is that every reward cycle (see below) the block reward given for mining a block is reduced by approximately 1%.
Block reward change     | 6,144 blocks | The number of blocks between block reward changes. This occurs approximately every 3 weeks. Decred uses a more frequent change cycle (about 3 weeks compared to Bitcoins 4 years), but the magnitude of the change is much less (about 1% per cycle whereas Bitcoin is 50%). This is designed to reduce the shock in markets when a change occurs.
Block reward share      | 60/30/10     | The reward for a block is split between miners and the Decred development team as follows: PoW miners get 60% of the reward to reimburse them for electricity and hardware expenses. PoS miners get 6% of the reward each (30% for 5 votes) <what happens if less than 5 vote?>. This encourages people to hold their coins and invest in the Decred network. The development team receives 10% to help ensure the future of Decred by funding ongoing development.
